# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

NOTE: As semantic versioning states all 0.y.z releases can contain breaking changes in API (flags, grpc API, any backward compatibility)

We use *breaking* word for marking changes that are not backward compatible (relates only to v0.y.z releases.)

## Unreleased

- [#1969](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1969) Sidecar: allow setting http connection pool size via flags
- [#1967](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/1967) Receive: Allow local TSDB compaction
- [#1975](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1975) Store Gateway: fixed panic caused by memcached servers selector when there's 1 memcached node
- [#1970](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/1970) *breaking* Receive: Use gRPC for forwarding requests between peers. Note that existing values for the `--receive.local-endpoint` flag and the endpoints in the hashring configuration file must now specify the receive gRPC port and must be updated to be a simple `host:port` combination, e.g. `127.0.0.1:10901`, rather than a full HTTP URL, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:10902/api/v1/receive`.

### Fixed

- [#1656](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1656) Store Gateway: Store now starts metric and status probe HTTP server earlier in its start-up sequence. `/-/healthy` endpoint now starts to respond with success earlier. `/metrics` endpoint starts serving metrics earlier as well. Make sure to point your readiness probes to the `/-/ready` endpoint rather than `/metrics`.
- [#1669](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1669) Store Gateway: Fixed store sharding. Now it does not load excluded meta.jsons and load/fetch index-cache.json files.
- [#1670](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1670) Sidecar: Fixed un-ordered blocks upload. Sidecar now uploads the oldest blocks first.

- [#1725](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1725) & [#1718](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1718) Store Gateway: Per request memory improvements.

### Changed

- [#1666](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1666) Compact: `thanos_compact_group_compactions_total` now counts block compactions, so operations that resulted in a compacted block. The old behaviour
is now exposed by new metric: `thanos_compact_group_compaction_runs_started_total` and `thanos_compact_group_compaction_runs_completed_total` which counts compaction runs overall.
- [#1748](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1748) Updated all dependencies.
- [#1694](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1694) `prober_ready` and `prober_healthy` metrics are removed, for sake of `status`. Now `status` exposes same metric with a label, `check`. `check` can have "healty" or "ready" depending on status of the probe.
- [#1790](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1790) Ruler: Fixes subqueries support for ruler.
- [#1769](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1769) & [#1545](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1545) Adjusted most of the metrics histogram buckets.

## [v0.8.1](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.8.1) - 2019.10.14

### Fixed

- [#1632](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/1632) Removes the duplicated external labels detection on Thanos Querier; warning only; Made Store Gateway compatible with older Querier versions.
  * NOTE: `thanos_store_nodes_grpc_connections` metric is now per `external_labels` and `store_type`. It is a recommended  metric for Querier storeAPIs. `thanos_store_node_info` is marked as obsolete and will be removed in next release.
  * NOTE2: Store Gateway is now advertising artificial: `"@thanos_compatibility_store_type=store"` label. This is to have the current Store Gateway compatible with Querier pre v0.8.0.
  This label can be disabled by hidden `debug.advertise-compatibility-label=false` flag on Store Gateway.

## [v0.8.0](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.8.0) - 2019.10.10

- [#1268](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1268) Thanos Sidecar added support for newest Prometheus streaming remote read added [here](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/5703). This massively improves memory required by single
  request for both Prometheus and sidecar. Single requests now should take constant amount of memory on sidecar, so resource consumption prediction is now straightforward. This will be used if you have Prometheus `2.13` or `2.12-master`.
- [#1358](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1358) Added `part_size` configuration option for HTTP multipart requests minimum part size for S3 storage type

  - [ENHANCEMENT] Query performance improvement: Efficient iteration and search in HashForLabels and HashWithoutLabels. #5707
  - [ENHANCEMENT] Optimize queries using regexp for set lookups. tsdb#602
  - [BUGFIX] prometheus_tsdb_compactions_failed_total is now incremented on any compaction failure. tsdb#613
  - [BUGFIX] PromQL: Correctly display {__name__="a"}.
- [#1338](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1338) Thanos Query still warns on store API duplicate, but allows a single one from duplicated set. This is gracefully warn about the problematic logic and not disrupt immediately.

- [#1410](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1410) Fix for CVE-2019-10215

### Deprecated

- [#1458](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1458) Thanos Query and Receive now use common instrumentation middleware. As as result, for sake of `http_requests_total` and `http_request_duration_seconds_bucket`; Thanos Query no longer exposes `thanos_query_api_instant_query_duration_seconds`, `thanos_query_api_range_query_duration_second` metrics and Thanos Receive no longer exposes `thanos_http_request_duration_seconds`, `thanos_http_requests_total`, `thanos_http_response_size_bytes`.

## [v0.6.0](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.6.0) - 2019.07.18

### Added

- [#1097](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1097) Added `thanos check rules` linter for Thanos rule rules files.

- [#1253](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1253) Add support for specifying a maximum amount of retries when using Azure Blob storage (default: no retries).

- [#1244](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1244) Thanos Compact now exposes new metrics `thanos_compact_downsample_total` and `thanos_compact_downsample_failures_total` which are useful to catch when errors happen

- [#1260](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1260) Thanos Query/Rule now exposes metrics `thanos_querier_store_apis_dns_provider_results` and `thanos_ruler_query_apis_dns_provider_results` which tell how many addresses were configured and how many were actually discovered respectively

- [#1248](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1248) Add a web UI to show the state of remote storage.

- [#1217](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1217) Thanos Receive gained basic hashring support

- [#1243](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1243) Thanos Receive got an ability to forward time series data between nodes. Now you can pass the hashring configuration via `--receive.hashrings-file`; the refresh interval `--receive.hashrings-file-refresh-interval`; the name of the local node's name `--receive.local-endpoint`; and finally the header's name which is used to determine the tenant `--receive.tenant-header`.

- [#1147](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1147) Support for the Jaeger tracer has been added!

*breaking* New common flags were added for configuring tracing: `--tracing.config-file` and `--tracing.config`. You can either pass a file to Thanos with the tracing configuration or pass it in the command line itself. Old `--gcloudtrace.*` flags were removed :warning:

To migrate over the old `--gcloudtrace.*` configuration, your tracing configuration should look like this:

```yaml

---
type: STACKDRIVER
config:
- service_name: 'foo'
  project_id: '123'
  sample_factor: 123
```

The other `type` you can use is `JAEGER` now. The `config` keys and values are Jaeger specific and you can find all of the information [here](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-go#environment-variables).

### Changed

- [#1284](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1284) Add support for multiple label-sets in Info gRPC service.
This deprecates the single `Labels` slice of the `InfoResponse`, in a future release backward compatible handling for the single set of Labels will be removed. Upgrading to v0.6.0 or higher is advised.
*breaking* If you run have duplicate queries in your Querier configuration with hierarchical federation of multiple Queries this PR makes Thanos Querier to detect this case and block all duplicates. Refer to 0.6.1 which at least allows for single replica to work.

- [#1314](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1314) Removes `http_request_duration_microseconds` (Summary) and adds `http_request_duration_seconds` (Histogram) from http server instrumentation used in Thanos APIs and UIs.

- [#1321](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1321) Thanos Query now fails early on a query which only uses external labels - this improves clarity in certain situations

### Fixed

- [#1227](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1227) Some context handling issues were fixed in Thanos Compact; some unnecessary memory allocations were removed in the hot path of Thanos Store.

- [#1183](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1183) Compactor now correctly propagates retriable/haltable errors which means that it will not unnecessarily restart if such an error occurs

- [#1231](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1231) Receive now correctly handles SIGINT and closes without deadlocking

- [#1278](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1278) Fixed inflated values problem with `sum()` on Thanos Query

- [#1280](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1280) Fixed a problem with concurrent writes to a `map` in Thanos Query while rendering the UI

- [#1311](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1311) Fixed occasional panics in Compact and Store when using Azure Blob cloud storage caused by lack of error checking in client library.

- [#1322](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1322) Removed duplicated closing of the gRPC listener - this gets rid of harmless messages like `store gRPC listener: close tcp 0.0.0.0:10901: use of closed network connection` when those programs are being closed

### Deprecated

- [#1216](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1216) the old "Command-line flags" has been removed from Thanos Query UI since it was not populated and because we are striving for consistency

## [v0.5.0](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.5.0) - 2019.06.05

TL;DR: Store LRU cache is no longer leaking, Upgraded Thanos UI to Prometheus 2.9, Fixed auto-downsampling, Moved to Go 1.12.5 and more.

This version moved tarballs to Golang 1.12.5 from 1.11 as well, so same warning applies if you use `container_memory_usage_bytes` from cadvisor. Use `container_memory_working_set_bytes` instead.

*breaking* As announced couple of times this release also removes gossip with all configuration flags (`--cluster.*`).

### Fixed

- [#1142](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1142) fixed major leak on store LRU cache for index items (postings and series).
- [#1163](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1163) sidecar is no longer blocking for custom Prometheus versions/builds. It only checks if flags return non 404, then it performs optional checks.
- [#1146](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1146) store/bucket: make getFor() work with interleaved resolutions.
- [#1157](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1157) querier correctly handles duplicated stores when some store changes external labels in place.

### Added

- [#1094](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1094) Allow configuring the response header timeout for the S3 client.

### Changed

- [#1118](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1118) *breaking* swift: Added support for cross-domain authentication by introducing `userDomainID`, `userDomainName`, `projectDomainID`, `projectDomainName`.

## Deprecated

- [#1008](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1008) *breaking* Removed Gossip implementation. All `--cluster.*` flags removed and Thanos will error out if any is provided.

## [v0.4.0](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.4.0) - 2019.05.3

:warning: **IMPORTANT** :warning: This is the last release that supports gossip. From Thanos v0.5.0, gossip will be completely removed.

This release also disables gossip mode by default for all components.
See [this](docs/proposals/201809_gossip-removal.md) for more details.

:warning: This release moves Thanos docker images (NOT artifacts by accident) to Golang 1.12. This release includes change in GC's memory release which gives following effect (source: https://golang.org/doc/go1.12):

> On Linux, the runtime now uses MADV_FREE to release unused memory. This is more efficient but may result in higher reported RSS. The kernel will reclaim the unused data when it is needed. To revert to the Go 1.11 behavior (MADV_DONTNEED), set the environment variable GODEBUG=madvdontneed=1.

If you want to see exact memory allocation of Thanos process:
* Use `go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes` metric exposed by Golang or `container_memory_working_set_bytes` exposed by cadvisor.
* Add `GODEBUG=madvdontneed=1` before running Thanos binary to revert to memory releasing to pre 1.12 logic.

Using cadvisor `container_memory_usage_bytes` metric could be misleading e.g: https://github.com/google/cadvisor/issues/2242

### Added

- [thanos.io](https://thanos.io) website & automation :tada:
- [#1053](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1053) compactor: Compactor & store gateway now handles incomplete uploads gracefully. Added hard limit on how long block upload can take (30m).
- [#811](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/811) Remote write receiver component :heart: :heart: thanks to RedHat (@brancz) contribution.
- [#910](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/910) Query's stores UI page is now sorted by type and old DNS or File SD stores are removed after 5 minutes (configurable via the new `--store.unhealthy-timeout=5m` flag).
- [#905](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/905) Thanos support for Query API: /api/v1/labels. Notice that the API was added in Prometheus v2.6.
- [#798](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/798) Ability to limit the maximum number of concurrent request to Series() calls in Thanos Store and the maximum amount of samples we handle.
- [#1060](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1060) Allow specifying region attribute in S3 storage configuration

:warning: **WARNING** :warning: #798 adds a new default limit to Thanos Store: `--store.grpc.series-max-concurrency`. Most likely you will want to make it the same as `--query.max-concurrent` on Thanos Query.

New options:

  New Store flags:

    * `--store.grpc.series-sample-limit` limits the amount of samples that might be retrieved on a single Series() call. By default it is 0. Consider enabling it by setting it to more than 0 if you are running on limited resources.
    * `--store.grpc.series-max-concurrency` limits the number of concurrent Series() calls in Thanos Store. By default it is 20. Considering making it lower or bigger depending on the scale of your deployment.

  New Store metrics:

    * `thanos_bucket_store_queries_dropped_total` shows how many queries were dropped due to the samples limit;
    * `thanos_bucket_store_queries_concurrent_max` is a constant metric which shows how many Series() calls can concurrently be executed by Thanos Store;
    * `thanos_bucket_store_queries_in_flight` shows how many queries are currently "in flight" i.e. they are being executed;
    * `thanos_bucket_store_gate_duration_seconds` shows how many seconds it took for queries to pass through the gate in both cases - when that fails and when it does not.

  New Store tracing span:
    * `store_query_gate_ismyturn` shows how long it took for a query to pass (or not) through the gate.

- [#1016](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1016) Added option for another DNS resolver (miekg/dns client).
Note that this is required to have SRV resolution working on [Golang 1.11+ with KubeDNS below v1.14](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/27546)

   New Querier and Ruler flag: `-- store.sd-dns-resolver` which allows to specify resolver to use. Either `golang` or `miekgdns`

- [#986](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/986) Allow to save some startup & sync time in store gateway as it is no longer needed to compute index-cache from block index on its own for larger blocks.
  The store Gateway still can do it, but it first checks bucket if there is index-cached uploaded already.
  In the same time, compactor precomputes the index cache file on every compaction.

  New Compactor flag: `--index.generate-missing-cache-file` was added to allow quicker addition of index cache files. If enabled it precomputes missing files on compactor startup. Note that it will take time and it's only one-off step per bucket.

- [#887](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/887) Compact: Added new `--block-sync-concurrency` flag, which allows you to configure number of goroutines to use when syncing block metadata from object storage.
- [#928](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/928) Query: Added `--store.response-timeout` flag. If a Store doesn't send any data in this specified duration then a Store will be ignored and partial data will be returned if it's enabled. 0 disables timeout.
- [#893](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/893) S3 storage backend has graduated to `stable` maturity level.
- [#936](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/936) Azure storage backend has graduated to `stable` maturity level.
- [#937](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/937) S3: added trace functionality. You can add `trace.enable: true` to enable the minio client's verbose logging.
- [#953](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/953) Compact: now has a hidden flag `--debug.accept-malformed-index`. Compaction index verification will ignore out of order label names.
- [#963](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/963) GCS: added possibility to inline ServiceAccount into GCS config.
- [#1010](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1010) Compact: added new flag `--compact.concurrency`. Number of goroutines to use when compacting groups.
- [#1028](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1028) Query: added `--query.default-evaluation-interval`, which sets default evaluation interval for sub queries.
- [#980](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/980) Ability to override Azure storage endpoint for other regions (China)
- [#1021](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1021) Query API `series` now supports POST method.
- [#939](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/939) Query API `query_range` now supports POST method.

### Changed

- [#970](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/970) Deprecated `partial_response_disabled` proto field. Added `partial_response_strategy` instead. Both in gRPC and Query API.
  No `PartialResponseStrategy` field for `RuleGroups` by default means `abort` strategy (old PartialResponse disabled) as this is recommended option for Rules and alerts.

  Metrics:

    * Added `thanos_rule_evaluation_with_warnings_total` to Ruler.
    * DNS `thanos_ruler_query_apis*` are now `thanos_ruler_query_apis_*` for consistency.
    * DNS `thanos_querier_store_apis*` are now `thanos_querier_store_apis__*` for consistency.
    * Query Gate `thanos_bucket_store_series*` are now `thanos_bucket_store_series_*` for consistency.
    * Most of thanos ruler metris related to rule manager has `strategy` label.

  Ruler tracing spans:

    * `/rule_instant_query HTTP[client]` is now `/rule_instant_query_part_resp_abort HTTP[client]"` if request is for abort strategy.

- [#1009](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1009): Upgraded Prometheus (~v2.7.0-rc.0 to v2.8.1)  and TSDB (`v0.4.0` to `v0.6.1`) deps.

  Changes that affects Thanos:
   * query:
     * [ENHANCEMENT] In histogram_quantile merge buckets with equivalent le values. #5158.
     * [ENHANCEMENT] Show list of offending labels in the error message in many-to-many scenarios. #5189

     * [BUGFIX] prometheus_rule_group_last_duration_seconds now reports seconds instead of nanoseconds. Fixes our [issue #1027](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/1027)
     * [BUGFIX] Fix sorting of rule groups. #5260
   * store: [ENHANCEMENT] Fast path for EmptyPostings cases in Merge, Intersect and Without.
   * tooling: [FEATURE] New dump command to tsdb tool to dump all samples.
   * compactor:
      * [ENHANCEMENT] When closing the db any running compaction will be cancelled so it doesn't block.
      * [CHANGE] *breaking* Renamed flag `--sync-delay` to `--consistency-delay` [#1053](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1053)

  For ruler essentially whole TSDB CHANGELOG applies between v0.4.0-v0.6.1: https://github.com/prometheus/tsdb/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

  Note that this was added on TSDB and Prometheus: [FEATURE] Time-ovelapping blocks are now allowed. #370
  Whoever due to nature of Thanos compaction (distributed systems), for safety reason this is disabled for Thanos compactor for now.

- [#868](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/868) Go has been updated to 1.12.
- [#1055](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1055) Gossip flags are now disabled by default and deprecated.

### Fixed

- [#921](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/921) `thanos_objstore_bucket_last_successful_upload_time` now does not appear when no blocks have been uploaded so far.
- [#966](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/966) Bucket: verify no longer warns about overlapping blocks, that overlap `0s`
- [#848](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/848) Compact: now correctly works with time series with duplicate labels.
- [#894](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/894) Thanos Rule: UI now correctly shows evaluation time.
- [#865](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/865) Query: now properly parses DNS SRV Service Discovery.
- [#889](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/889) Store: added safeguard against merging posting groups segfault
- [#941](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/941) Sidecar: added better handling of intermediate restarts.
- [#933](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/933) Query: Fixed 30 seconds lag of adding new store to query.
- [#962](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/962) Sidecar: Make config reloader file writes atomic.

- [#873](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/873) Store: fix set index cache LRU

:warning: **WARNING** :warning: #873 fix fixes actual handling of `index-cache-size`. Handling of limit for this cache was
broken so it was unbounded all the time. From this release actual value matters and is extremely low by default. To "revert"
the old behaviour (no boundary), use a large enough value.

### Fixed

- [#833](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/833) Store Gateway matcher regression for intersecting with empty posting.
- [#867](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/867) Fixed race condition in sidecare between reloader and shipper.
