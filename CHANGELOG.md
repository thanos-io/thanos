### Added

- [#5814](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5814) Store: Added metric `thanos_bucket_store_postings_size_bytes` that shows the distribution of how many postings (in bytes) were needed for each Series() call in Thanos Store. Useful for determining limits.
- [#5703](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5703) StoreAPI: Added `hash` field to series' chunks. Store gateway and receive implements that field and proxy leverage that for quicker deduplication.
- [#5801](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5801) Store: Added a new flag `--store.grpc.downloaded-bytes-limit` that limits the number of bytes downloaded in each Series/LabelNames/LabelValues call. Use `thanos_bucket_store_postings_size_bytes` for determining the limits.
- [#5836](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5836) Receive: Added hidden flag `tsdb.memory-snapshot-on-shutdown` to enable experimental TSDB feature to snapshot on shutdown. This is intended to speed up receiver restart.

Disabled by default (set to 0s). Please note if you enable this option and you use compactor, make sure you set the `--enable-vertical-compaction` flag, otherwise you might risk compactor halt.
- [#5889](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5889) Query Frontend: Added support for vertical sharding `label_replace` and `label_join` functions.
- [#5865](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5865) Compact: Retry on sync metas error.
- [#5819](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5819) Store: Added a few objectives for Store's data summaries (touched/fetched amount and sizes). They are: 50, 95, and 99 quantiles.
- [#5837](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5837) Store: Added streaming retrival of series from object storage.
- [#5940](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5940) Objstore: Support for authenticating to Swift using application credentials.
- [#5945](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5945) Tools: Added new `no-downsample` marker to skip blocks when downsampling via `thanos tools bucket mark --marker=no-downsample-mark.json`. This will skip downsampling for blocks with the new marker.

### Changed

- [#5785](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5785) Query: `thanos_store_nodes_grpc_connections` now trimms `external_labels` label name longer than 1000 character. It also allows customizations in what labels to preserve using `query.conn-metric.label` flag.
- [#5542](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5542) Mixin: Added query concurrency panel to Querier dashboard.
- [#5846](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5846) Query Frontend: vertical query sharding supports subqueries.
- [#5593](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5593) Cache: switch Redis client to [Rueidis](https://github.com/rueian/rueidis). Rueidis is [faster](https://github.com/rueian/rueidis#benchmark-comparison-with-go-redis-v9) and provides [client-side caching](https://redis.io/docs/manual/client-side-caching/). It is highly recommended to use it so that repeated requests for the same key would not be needed.
- [#5896](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5896) *: Upgrade Prometheus to v0.40.7 without implementing native histogram support. *Querying native histograms will fail with `Error executing query: invalid chunk encoding "<unknown>"` and native histograms in write requests are ignored.*
- [#5909](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/5909) Receive: Compact tenant head after no appends have happened for 1.5 `tsdb.max-block-size`.

## [v0.19.0](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.19.0) - 2021.03.31

- [#3700](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3700) Compact/Web: Make old bucket viewer UI work with vanilla Prometheus blocks.
- [#3657](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3657) \*: It's now possible to configure HTTP transport options for S3 client.
- [#3752](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3752) Compact/Store: Added `--block-meta-fetch-concurrency` allowing to configure number of go routines for block metadata synchronization.

- [#3031](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3031) Compact/Sidecar/Receive/Rule: Added `--hash-func`. If some function has been specified, writers calculate hashes using that function of each file in a block before uploading them. If those hashes exist in the `meta.json` file then Compact does not download the files if they already exist on disk and with the same hash. This also means that the data directory passed to Thanos Compact is only *cleared once at boot* or *if everything succeeds*. So, if you, for example, use persistent volumes on k8s and your Thanos Compact crashes or fails to make an iteration properly then the last downloaded files are not wiped from the disk. The directories that were created the last time are only wiped again after a successful iteration or if the previously picked up blocks have disappeared.

### Fixed

- [#3532](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3532) compact: do not cleanup blocks on boot. Reverts the behavior change introduced in [#3115](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3115) as in some very bad cases the boot of Thanos Compact took a very long time since there were a lot of blocks-to-be-cleaned.
- [#3520](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3520) Fix index out of bound bug when comparing ZLabelSets.

- [#3312](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3312) s3: add list_objects_version config option for compatibility.
- [#3356](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3356) Query Frontend: Add a flag to disable step alignment middleware for query range.
- [#3378](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3378) Ruler: added the ability to send queries via the HTTP method POST. Helps when alerting/recording rules are extra long because it encodes the actual parameters inside of the body instead of the URI. Thanos Ruler now uses POST by default unless `--query.http-method` is set `GET`.
- [#3381](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3381) Querier UI: Add ability to enable or disable metric autocomplete functionality.
- [#2979](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2979) Replicator: Add the ability to replicate blocks within a time frame by passing --min-time and --max-time
- [#3398](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3398) Query Frontend: Add default config for query frontend memcached config.
- [#3277](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3277) Thanos Query: Introduce dynamic lookback interval. This allows queries with large step to make use of downsampled data.
- [#3409](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3409) Compactor: Added support for no-compact-mark.json which excludes the block from compaction.
- [#3245](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3245) Query Frontend: Add `query-frontend.org-id-header` flag to specify HTTP header(s) to populate slow query log (e.g. X-Grafana-User).
- [#3431](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3431) Store: Added experimental support to lazy load index-headers at query time. When enabled via `--store.enable-index-header-lazy-reader` flag, the store-gateway will load into memory an index-header only once it's required at query time. Index-header will be automatically released after `--store.index-header-lazy-reader-idle-timeout` of inactivity.
  - This, generally, reduces baseline memory usage of store when inactive, as well as a total number of mapped files (which is limited to 64k in some systems.
- [#3437](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3437) StoreAPI: Added `hints` field to `LabelNamesResponse` and `LabelValuesResponse`. Hints in an opaque data structure that can be used to carry additional information from the store and its content is implementation specific.
  - This, generally, reduces baseline memory usage of store when inactive, as well as a total number of mapped files (which is limited to 64k in some systems.
- [#3415](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3415) Tools: Added `thanos tools bucket mark` command that allows to mark given block for deletion or for no-compact

### Fixed

- [#3257](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3257) Ruler: Prevent Ruler from crashing when using default DNS to lookup hosts that results in "No such hosts" errors.
- [#3331](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3331) Disable Azure blob exception logging
- [#3341](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3341) Disable Azure blob syslog exception logging
- [#3414](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3414) Set CORS for Query Frontend
- [#3437](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3437) Add external labels to Labels APIs.

### Changed

- [#3452](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3452) Store: Index cache posting compression is now enabled by default. Removed `experimental.enable-index-cache-postings-compression` flag.
- [#3410](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3410) Compactor: Changed metric `thanos_compactor_blocks_marked_for_deletion_total` to `thanos_compactor_blocks_marked_total` with `marker` label. Compactor will now automatically disable compaction for blocks with large index that would output blocks after compaction larger than specified value (by default: 64GB). This automatically handles the Promethus [format limit](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/1424).
- [#2906](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2906) Tools: Refactor Bucket replicate execution. Removed all `thanos_replicate_origin_.*` metrics.
  - `thanos_replicate_origin_meta_loads_total` can be replaced by `blocks_meta_synced{state="loaded"}`.
  - `thanos_replicate_origin_partial_meta_reads_total` can be replaced by `blocks_meta_synced{state="failed"}`.
- [#3309](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3309) Compact: *breaking :warning:* Rename metrics to match naming convention. This includes metrics starting with `thanos_compactor` to `thanos_compact`, `thanos_querier` to `thanos_query` and `thanos_ruler` to `thanos_rule`.

## [v0.16.0](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.16.0) - 2020.10.26

Highlights:

- New Thanos component, [Query Frontend](docs/components/query-frontend.md) has more options and supports shared cache (currently: Memcached).
- Added debug mode in Thanos UI that allows to filter Stores to query from by their IPs from Store page (!). This helps enormously in e.g debugging the slowest store etc. All raw Thanos API allows passing `storeMatch[]` arguments with `__address__` matchers.
- Improved debuggability on all Thanos components by exposing [off-CPU profiles thanks to fgprof endpoint](https://github.com/felixge/fgprof).
- Significantly improved sidecar latency and CPU usage for metrics fetches.

### Fixed

- [#3234](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3234) UI: Fix assets not loading when `--web.prefix-header` is used.

The zero value means range covers the time since the beginning.
- [#3207](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3207) Query Frontend: Added `cache-compression-type` flag to use compression in the query frontend cache.
- [#3122](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3122) \*: All Thanos components have now `/debug/fgprof` endpoint on HTTP port allowing to get [off-CPU profiles as well](https://github.com/felixge/fgprof).
- [#3109](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/3109) Query Frontend: Added support for `Cache-Control` HTTP response header which controls caching behaviour. So far `no-store` value is supported and it makes the response skip cache.

## [v0.12.0](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.12.0) - 2020.04.15

### Fixed

- [#2288](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2288) Ruler: fixes issue #2281, a bug causing incorrect parsing of query address with path prefix.
- [#2238](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2238) Ruler: fixed issue #2204, where a bug in alert queue signaling filled up the queue and alerts were dropped.
- [#2231](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2231) Bucket Web: sort chunks by thanos.downsample.resolution for better grouping.
- [#2254](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2254) Bucket: fix issue where metrics were registered multiple times in bucket replicate.
- [#2271](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2271) Bucket Web: fixed issue #2260, where the bucket passes null when storage is empty.
- [#2339](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2339) Query: fix a bug where `--store.unhealthy-timeout` was never respected.
- [#2208](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2208) Query and Rule: fix handling of `web.route-prefix` to correctly handle `/` and prefixes that do not begin with a `/`.
- [#2311](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2311) Receive: ensure receive component serves TLS when TLS configuration is provided.
- [#2319](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2319) Query: fixed inconsistent naming of metrics.
- [#2390](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2390) Store: fixed bug that was causing all posting offsets to be used instead of only 1/32 as intended; added hidden flag to control this behavior.
- [#2393](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2393) Store: fixed bug causing certain not-existing label values queried to fail with "invalid-size" error from binary header.
- [#2382](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2382) Store: fixed bug causing partial writes of index-header.
- [#2383](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2383) Store: handle expected errors correctly, e.g. do not increment failure counters.

### Added

- [#2252](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2252) Query: add new `--store-strict` flag. More information available [here](docs/proposals-done/202001-thanos-query-health-handling.md).
- [#2265](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2265) Compact: add `--wait-interval` to specify compaction wait interval between consecutive compact runs when `--wait` is enabled.
- [#2250](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2250) Compact: enable vertical compaction for offline deduplication (experimental). Uses `--deduplication.replica-label` flag to specify the replica label on which to deduplicate (hidden). Please note that this uses a NAIVE algorithm for merging (no smart replica deduplication, just chaining samples together). This works well for deduplication of blocks with **precisely the same samples** like those produced by Receiver replication. We plan to add a smarter algorithm in the following weeks.
- [#1714](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1714) Compact: the compact component now exposes the bucket web UI when it is run as a long-lived process.
- [#2304](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2304) Store: added `max_item_size` configuration option to memcached-based index cache. This should be set to the max item size configured in memcached (`-I` flag) in order to not waste network round-trips to cache items larger than the limit configured in memcached.
- [#2297](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2297) Store: add `--experimental.enable-index-cache-postings-compression` flag to enable re-encoding and compressing postings before storing them into the cache. Compressed postings take about 10% of the original size.
- [#2357](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2357) Compact and Store: the compact and store components now serve the bucket UI on `:<http-port>/loaded`, which shows exactly the blocks that are currently seen by compactor and the store gateway. The compactor also serves a different bucket UI on `:<http-port>/global`, which shows the status of object storage without any filters.
- [#2172](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2172) Store: add support for sharding the store component based on the label hash.
- [#2113](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2113) Bucket: added `thanos bucket replicate` command to replicate blocks from one bucket to another.
- [#1922](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1922) Docs: create a new document to explain sharding in Thanos.
- [#2230](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2230) Store: optimize conversion of labels.

### Changed

- [#2136](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2136) *breaking* Store, Compact, Bucket: schedule block deletion by adding deletion-mark.json. This adds a consistent way for multiple readers and writers to access object storage. Since there are no consistency guarantees provided by some Object Storage providers, this PR adds a consistent lock-free way of dealing with Object Storage irrespective of the choice of object storage. In order to achieve this co-ordination, blocks are not deleted directly. Instead, blocks are marked for deletion by uploading the `deletion-mark.json` file for the block that was chosen to be deleted. This file contains Unix time of when the block was marked for deletion. If you want to keep existing behavior, you should add `--delete-delay=0s` as a flag.
- [#2090](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/2090) *breaking* Downsample command: the `downsample` command has moved and is now a sub-command of the `thanos bucket` sub-command; it cannot be called via `thanos downsample` any more.
- [#2294](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2294) Store: optimizations for fetching postings. Queries using `=~".*"` matchers or negation matchers (`!=...` or `!~...`) benefit the most.
- [#2301](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2301) Ruler: exit with an error when initialization fails.
- [#2310](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2310) Query: report timespan 0 to 0 when discovering no stores.
- [#2330](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2330) Store: index-header is no longer experimental. It is enabled by default for store Gateway. You can disable it with new hidden flag: `--store.disable-index-header`. The `--experimental.enable-index-header` flag was removed.
- [#1848](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1848) Ruler: allow returning error messages when a reload is triggered via HTTP.
- [#2270](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2277) All: Thanos components will now print stack traces when they error out.

## [v0.11.0](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.11.0) - 2020.03.02

### Fixed

- [#2033](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2033) Minio-go: Fixed Issue #1494 support Web Identity providers for IAM credentials for AWS EKS.
- [#1985](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1985) Store Gateway: Fixed case where series entry is larger than 64KB in index.

### Added

- [#2003](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2003) Query: Support downsampling for /series.
- [#1952](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1952) Store Gateway: Implemented [binary index header](docs/proposals-done/201912-thanos-binary-index-header.md). This significantly reduces resource consumption (memory, CPU, net bandwidth) for startup and data loading processes as well as baseline memory. This means that adding more blocks into object storage, without querying them will use almost no resources. This, however, **still means that querying large amounts of data** will result in high spikes of memory and CPU use as before, due to simply fetching large amounts of metrics data. Since we fixed baseline, we are now focusing on query performance optimizations in separate initiatives. To enable experimental `index-header` mode run store with hidden `experimental.enable-index-header` flag.
- [#2009](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2009) Store Gateway: Minimum age of all blocks before they are being read. Set it to a safe value (e.g 30m) if your object storage is eventually consistent. GCS and S3 are (roughly) strongly consistent.

- [#1967](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/1967) Receive: Allow local TSDB compaction.
- [#1939](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1939) Ruler: Add TLS and authentication support for query endpoints with the `--query.config` and `--query.config-file` CLI flags. See [documentation](docs/components/rule.md#configuration) for further information.
- [#1982](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1982) Ruler: Add support for Alertmanager v2 API endpoints.
- [#2030](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2030) Query: Add `thanos_proxy_store_empty_stream_responses_total` metric for number of empty responses from stores.

- [#2008](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2008) Querier, Receiver, Sidecar, Store: Add gRPC [health check](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md) endpoints.
- [#2145](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2145) Tracing: track query sent to prometheus via remote read api.

### Changed

- [#1970](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/1970) *breaking* Receive: Use gRPC for forwarding requests between peers. Note that existing values for the `--receive.local-endpoint` flag and the endpoints in the hashring configuration file must now specify the receive gRPC port and must be updated to be a simple `host:port` combination, e.g. `127.0.0.1:10901`, rather than a full HTTP URL, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:10902/api/v1/receive`.
- [#1933](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1933) Add a flag `--tsdb.wal-compression` to configure whether to enable tsdb wal compression in ruler and receiver.
- [#2021](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2021) Rename metric `thanos_query_duplicated_store_address` to `thanos_query_duplicated_store_addresses_total` and `thanos_rule_duplicated_query_address` to `thanos_rule_duplicated_query_addresses_total`.
- [#2166](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2166) Bucket Web: improve the tooltip for the bucket UI; it was reconstructed and now exposes much more information about blocks.

## [v0.10.1](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.10.1) - 2020.01.24

### Fixed

- [#2015](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2015) Sidecar: Querier /api/v1/series bug fixed when time range was ignored inside sidecar. The bug was noticeable for example when using Grafana template variables.
- [#2120](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2120) Bucket Web: Set state of status prober properly.

### Fixed

- [#1656](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1656) Store Gateway: Store now starts metric and status probe HTTP server earlier in its start-up sequence. `/-/healthy` endpoint now starts to respond with success earlier. `/metrics` endpoint starts serving metrics earlier as well. Make sure to point your readiness probes to the `/-/ready` endpoint rather than `/metrics`.
- [#1669](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1669) Store Gateway: Fixed store sharding. Now it does not load excluded meta.jsons and load/fetch index-cache.json files.
- [#1670](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1670) Sidecar: Fixed un-ordered blocks upload. Sidecar now uploads the oldest blocks first.

### Changed

- [#1666](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1666) Compact: `thanos_compact_group_compactions_total` now counts block compactions, so operations that resulted in a compacted block. The old behaviour is now exposed by new metric: `thanos_compact_group_compaction_runs_started_total` and `thanos_compact_group_compaction_runs_completed_total` which counts compaction runs overall.
- [#1748](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1748) Updated all dependencies.
- [#1694](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1694) `prober_ready` and `prober_healthy` metrics are removed, for sake of `status`. Now `status` exposes same metric with a label, `check`. `check` can have "healty" or "ready" depending on status of the probe.

- [#1769](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1769) & [#1545](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1545) Adjusted most of the metrics histogram buckets.

## [v0.8.1](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.8.1) - 2019.10.14

### Fixed

- [#1632](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/1632) Removes the duplicated external labels detection on Thanos Querier; warning only; Made Store Gateway compatible with older Querier versions.
  - NOTE: `thanos_store_nodes_grpc_connections` metric is now per `external_labels` and `store_type`. It is a recommended metric for Querier storeAPIs. `thanos_store_node_info` is marked as obsolete and will be removed in next release.
  - NOTE2: Store Gateway is now advertising artificial: `"@thanos_compatibility_store_type=store"` label. This is to have the current Store Gateway compatible with Querier pre v0.8.0. This label can be disabled by hidden `debug.advertise-compatibility-label=false` flag on Store Gateway.

## [v0.8.0](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.8.0) - 2019.10.10

Lot's of improvements this release! Noteworthy items:

- First Katacoda tutorial! 🐱
- Fixed Deletion order causing Compactor to produce not needed 👻 blocks with missing random files.
- Store GW memory improvements (more to come!).
- Querier allows multiple deduplication labels.
- Both Compactor and Store Gateway can be **sharded** within the same bucket using relabelling!
- Sidecar exposed data from Prometheus can be now limited to given `min-time` (e.g 3h only).
- Numerous Thanos Receive improvements.

Make sure you check out Prometheus 2.13.0 as well. New release drastically improves usage and resource consumption of both Prometheus and sidecar with Thanos: https://prometheus.io/blog/2019/10/10/remote-read-meets-streaming/

### Added

  - Add relabel config (`--selector.relabel-config-file` and `selector.relabel-config`) into Thanos Store and Compact components. Selecting blocks to serve depends on the result of block labels relabeling.
  - For store gateway, advertise labels from "approved" blocks.
- [#1540](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1540) Thanos Downsample added `/-/ready` and `/-/healthy` endpoints.
- [#1538](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1538) Thanos Rule added `/-/ready` and `/-/healthy` endpoints.

- [#1268](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1268) Thanos Sidecar added support for newest Prometheus streaming remote read added [here](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/5703). This massively improves memory required by single request for both Prometheus and sidecar. Single requests now should take constant amount of memory on sidecar, so resource consumption prediction is now straightforward. This will be used if you have Prometheus `2.13` or `2.12-master`.
- [#1358](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1358) Added `part_size` configuration option for HTTP multipart requests minimum part size for S3 storage type
- [#1363](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1363) Thanos Receive now exposes `thanos_receive_hashring_nodes` and `thanos_receive_hashring_tenants` metrics to monitor status of hash-rings

- [#1380](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1380) Upgraded important dependencies: Prometheus to 2.11.1 and TSDB to 0.9.1. Some changes affecting Querier:
  - [ENHANCEMENT] Query performance improvement: Efficient iteration and search in HashForLabels and HashWithoutLabels. #5707
  - [ENHANCEMENT] Optimize queries using regexp for set lookups. tsdb#602
  - [BUGFIX] prometheus_tsdb_compactions_failed_total is now incremented on any compaction failure. tsdb#613
  - [BUGFIX] PromQL: Correctly display {**name**="a"}.
- [#1338](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1338) Thanos Query still warns on store API duplicate, but allows a single one from duplicated set. This is gracefully warn about the problematic logic and not disrupt immediately.
- [#1385](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1385) Thanos Compact exposes flag to disable downsampling `downsampling.disable`.

- [#1410](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1410) Fix for CVE-2019-10215

### Deprecated

- [#1458](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1458) Thanos Query and Receive now use common instrumentation middleware. As as result, for sake of `http_requests_total` and `http_request_duration_seconds_bucket`; Thanos Query no longer exposes `thanos_query_api_instant_query_duration_seconds`, `thanos_query_api_range_query_duration_second` metrics and Thanos Receive no longer exposes `thanos_http_request_duration_seconds`, `thanos_http_requests_total`, `thanos_http_response_size_bytes`.
- [#1423](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1423) Thanos Bench deprecated.

## [v0.6.0](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.6.0) - 2019.07.18

### Added

- [#1097](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1097) Added `thanos check rules` linter for Thanos rule rules files.

- [#1253](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1253) Add support for specifying a maximum amount of retries when using Azure Blob storage (default: no retries).

- [#1244](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1244) Thanos Compact now exposes new metrics `thanos_compact_downsample_total` and `thanos_compact_downsample_failures_total` which are useful to catch when errors happen

- [#1260](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1260) Thanos Query/Rule now exposes metrics `thanos_querier_store_apis_dns_provider_results` and `thanos_ruler_query_apis_dns_provider_results` which tell how many addresses were configured and how many were actually discovered respectively

- [#1248](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1248) Add a web UI to show the state of remote storage.

- [#1217](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1217) Thanos Receive gained basic hashring support

- [#1262](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1262) Thanos Receive got a new metric `thanos_http_requests_total` which shows how many requests were handled by it

- [#1243](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1243) Thanos Receive got an ability to forward time series data between nodes. Now you can pass the hashring configuration via `--receive.hashrings-file`; the refresh interval `--receive.hashrings-file-refresh-interval`; the name of the local node's name `--receive.local-endpoint`; and finally the header's name which is used to determine the tenant `--receive.tenant-header`.

- [#1147](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1147) Support for the Jaeger tracer has been added!

*breaking* New common flags were added for configuring tracing: `--tracing.config-file` and `--tracing.config`. You can either pass a file to Thanos with the tracing configuration or pass it in the command line itself. Old `--gcloudtrace.*` flags were removed :warning:

To migrate over the old `--gcloudtrace.*` configuration, your tracing configuration should look like this:

```yaml
---
type: STACKDRIVER
config:
  - service_name: "foo"
    project_id: "123"
    sample_factor: 123
```

The other `type` you can use is `JAEGER` now. The `config` keys and values are Jaeger specific and you can find all of the information [here](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-go#environment-variables).

### Changed

- [#1284](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1284) Add support for multiple label-sets in Info gRPC service. This deprecates the single `Labels` slice of the `InfoResponse`, in a future release backward compatible handling for the single set of Labels will be removed. Upgrading to v0.6.0 or higher is advised. *breaking* If you run have duplicate queries in your Querier configuration with hierarchical federation of multiple Queries this PR makes Thanos Querier to detect this case and block all duplicates. Refer to 0.6.1 which at least allows for single replica to work.

- [#1314](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1314) Removes `http_request_duration_microseconds` (Summary) and adds `http_request_duration_seconds` (Histogram) from http server instrumentation used in Thanos APIs and UIs.

- [#1287](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1287) Sidecar now waits on Prometheus' external labels before starting the uploading process

- [#1261](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1261) Thanos Receive now exposes metrics `thanos_http_request_duration_seconds` and `thanos_http_response_size_bytes` properly of each handler

- [#1274](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1274) Iteration limit has been lifted from the LRU cache so there should be no more spam of error messages as they were harmless

- [#1321](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1321) Thanos Query now fails early on a query which only uses external labels - this improves clarity in certain situations

### Fixed

- [#1227](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1227) Some context handling issues were fixed in Thanos Compact; some unnecessary memory allocations were removed in the hot path of Thanos Store.

- [#1183](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1183) Compactor now correctly propagates retriable/haltable errors which means that it will not unnecessarily restart if such an error occurs

- [#1231](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1231) Receive now correctly handles SIGINT and closes without deadlocking

- [#1278](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1278) Fixed inflated values problem with `sum()` on Thanos Query

- [#1280](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1280) Fixed a problem with concurrent writes to a `map` in Thanos Query while rendering the UI

- [#1311](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1311) Fixed occasional panics in Compact and Store when using Azure Blob cloud storage caused by lack of error checking in client library.

- [#1322](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1322) Removed duplicated closing of the gRPC listener - this gets rid of harmless messages like `store gRPC listener: close tcp 0.0.0.0:10901: use of closed network connection` when those programs are being closed

### Deprecated

- [#1216](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1216) the old "Command-line flags" has been removed from Thanos Query UI since it was not populated and because we are striving for consistency

## [v0.5.0](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.5.0) - 2019.06.05

TL;DR: Store LRU cache is no longer leaking, Upgraded Thanos UI to Prometheus 2.9, Fixed auto-downsampling, Moved to Go 1.12.5 and more.

This version moved tarballs to Golang 1.12.5 from 1.11 as well, so same warning applies if you use `container_memory_usage_bytes` from cadvisor. Use `container_memory_working_set_bytes` instead.

*breaking* As announced couple of times this release also removes gossip with all configuration flags (`--cluster.*`).

### Fixed

- [#1142](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1142) fixed major leak on store LRU cache for index items (postings and series).
- [#1163](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1163) sidecar is no longer blocking for custom Prometheus versions/builds. It only checks if flags return non 404, then it performs optional checks.

### Changed

- [#1118](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1118) *breaking* swift: Added support for cross-domain authentication by introducing `userDomainID`, `userDomainName`, `projectDomainID`, `projectDomainName`. The outdated terms `tenantID`, `tenantName` are deprecated and have been replaced by `projectID`, `projectName`.

## Deprecated

- [#1008](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1008) *breaking* Removed Gossip implementation. All `--cluster.*` flags removed and Thanos will error out if any is provided.

## [v0.4.0](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.4.0) - 2019.05.3

:warning: **IMPORTANT** :warning: This is the last release that supports gossip. From Thanos v0.5.0, gossip will be completely removed.

This release also disables gossip mode by default for all components. See [this](docs/proposals-done/201809-gossip-removal.md) for more details.

:warning: This release moves Thanos docker images (NOT artifacts by accident) to Golang 1.12. This release includes change in GC's memory release which gives following effect:

> On Linux, the runtime now uses MADV_FREE to release unused memory. This is more efficient but may result in higher reported RSS. The kernel will reclaim the unused data when it is needed. To revert to the Go 1.11 behavior (MADV_DONTNEED), set the environment variable GODEBUG=madvdontneed=1.

If you want to see exact memory allocation of Thanos process:

- Use `go_memstats_heap_alloc_bytes` metric exposed by Golang or `container_memory_working_set_bytes` exposed by cadvisor.
- Add `GODEBUG=madvdontneed=1` before running Thanos binary to revert to memory releasing to pre 1.12 logic.

Using cadvisor `container_memory_usage_bytes` metric could be misleading e.g: https://github.com/google/cadvisor/issues/2242

### Added

- [thanos.io](https://thanos.io) website & automation :tada:
- [#1053](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1053) compactor: Compactor & store gateway now handles incomplete uploads gracefully. Added hard limit on how long block upload can take (30m).
- [#811](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/811) Remote write receiver component :heart: :heart: thanks to RedHat (@brancz) contribution.
- [#910](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/910) Query's stores UI page is now sorted by type and old DNS or File SD stores are removed after 5 minutes (configurable via the new `--store.unhealthy-timeout=5m` flag).
- [#905](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/905) Thanos support for Query API: /api/v1/labels. Notice that the API was added in Prometheus v2.6.
- [#798](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/798) Ability to limit the maximum number of concurrent request to Series() calls in Thanos Store and the maximum amount of samples we handle.
- [#1060](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1060) Allow specifying region attribute in S3 storage configuration

:warning: **WARNING** :warning: #798 adds a new default limit to Thanos Store: `--store.grpc.series-max-concurrency`. Most likely you will want to make it the same as `--query.max-concurrent` on Thanos Query.

New options:

New Store flags:

```
* `--store.grpc.series-sample-limit` limits the amount of samples that might be retrieved on a single Series() call. By default it is 0. Consider enabling it by setting it to more than 0 if you are running on limited resources.
* `--store.grpc.series-max-concurrency` limits the number of concurrent Series() calls in Thanos Store. By default it is 20. Considering making it lower or bigger depending on the scale of your deployment.
```

New Store metrics:

```
* `thanos_bucket_store_queries_dropped_total` shows how many queries were dropped due to the samples limit;
* `thanos_bucket_store_queries_concurrent_max` is a constant metric which shows how many Series() calls can concurrently be executed by Thanos Store;
* `thanos_bucket_store_queries_in_flight` shows how many queries are currently "in flight" i.e. they are being executed;
* `thanos_bucket_store_gate_duration_seconds` shows how many seconds it took for queries to pass through the gate in both cases - when that fails and when it does not.
```

New Store tracing span: \* `store_query_gate_ismyturn` shows how long it took for a query to pass (or not) through the gate.

- [#1016](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1016) Added option for another DNS resolver (miekg/dns client). Note that this is required to have SRV resolution working on [Golang 1.11+ with KubeDNS below v1.14](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/27546)

  New Querier and Ruler flag: `-- store.sd-dns-resolver` which allows to specify resolver to use. Either `golang` or `miekgdns`

- [#986](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/986) Allow to save some startup & sync time in store gateway as it is no longer needed to compute index-cache from block index on its own for larger blocks. The store Gateway still can do it, but it first checks bucket if there is index-cached uploaded already. In the same time, compactor precomputes the index cache file on every compaction.

  New Compactor flag: `--index.generate-missing-cache-file` was added to allow quicker addition of index cache files. If enabled it precomputes missing files on compactor startup. Note that it will take time and it's only one-off step per bucket.

- [#887](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/887) Compact: Added new `--block-sync-concurrency` flag, which allows you to configure number of goroutines to use when syncing block metadata from object storage.
- [#928](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/928) Query: Added `--store.response-timeout` flag. If a Store doesn't send any data in this specified duration then a Store will be ignored and partial data will be returned if it's enabled. 0 disables timeout.
- [#893](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/893) S3 storage backend has graduated to `stable` maturity level.
- [#936](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/936) Azure storage backend has graduated to `stable` maturity level.
- [#937](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/937) S3: added trace functionality. You can add `trace.enable: true` to enable the minio client's verbose logging.
- [#953](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/953) Compact: now has a hidden flag `--debug.accept-malformed-index`. Compaction index verification will ignore out of order label names.
- [#963](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/963) GCS: added possibility to inline ServiceAccount into GCS config.
- [#1010](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1010) Compact: added new flag `--compact.concurrency`. Number of goroutines to use when compacting groups.
- [#1028](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1028) Query: added `--query.default-evaluation-interval`, which sets default evaluation interval for sub queries.
- [#980](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/980) Ability to override Azure storage endpoint for other regions (China)
- [#1021](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1021) Query API `series` now supports POST method.
- [#939](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/939) Query API `query_range` now supports POST method.

### Changed

- [#970](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/970) Deprecated `partial_response_disabled` proto field. Added `partial_response_strategy` instead. Both in gRPC and Query API. No `PartialResponseStrategy` field for `RuleGroups` by default means `abort` strategy (old PartialResponse disabled) as this is recommended option for Rules and alerts.

  Metrics:

  - Added `thanos_rule_evaluation_with_warnings_total` to Ruler.
  - DNS `thanos_ruler_query_apis*` are now `thanos_ruler_query_apis_*` for consistency.
  - DNS `thanos_querier_store_apis*` are now `thanos_querier_store_apis__*` for consistency.
  - Query Gate `thanos_bucket_store_series*` are now `thanos_bucket_store_series_*` for consistency.
  - Most of thanos ruler metris related to rule manager has `strategy` label.

  Ruler tracing spans:

  - `/rule_instant_query HTTP[client]` is now `/rule_instant_query_part_resp_abort HTTP[client]"` if request is for abort strategy.

- [#1009](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/1009): Upgraded Prometheus (~v2.7.0-rc.0 to v2.8.1) and TSDB (`v0.4.0` to `v0.6.1`) deps.

  For ruler essentially whole TSDB CHANGELOG applies between v0.4.0-v0.6.1: https://github.com/prometheus/tsdb/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

  Note that this was added on TSDB and Prometheus: [FEATURE] Time-ovelapping blocks are now allowed. #370 Whoever due to nature of Thanos compaction (distributed systems), for safety reason this is disabled for Thanos compactor for now.

## [v0.3.2](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.3.2) - 2019.03.04

### Added

- [#851](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/851) New read API endpoint for api/v1/rules and api/v1/alerts.
- [#873](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/873) Store: fix set index cache LRU

:warning: **WARNING** :warning: #873 fix fixes actual handling of `index-cache-size`. Handling of limit for this cache was broken so it was unbounded all the time. From this release actual value matters and is extremely low by default. To "revert" the old behaviour (no boundary), use a large enough value.

### Fixed

- [#833](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/833) Store Gateway matcher regression for intersecting with empty posting.
- [#867](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/867) Fixed race condition in sidecare between reloader and shipper.

## [v0.3.1](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/releases/tag/v0.3.1) - 2019.02.18

### Fixed
