## Overview

Thanos is a set of components that can be composed into a highly available metric system with unlimited storage capacity, which can be added seamlessly on top of existing Prometheus deployments.

Thanos is a [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) Incubating project.

Thanos leverages the Prometheus 2.0 storage format to cost-efficiently store historical metric data in any object storage while retaining fast query latencies. Additionally, it provides a global query view across all Prometheus installations and can merge data from Prometheus HA pairs on the fly.

Concretely the aims of the project are:

1. Global query view of metrics.
2. Unlimited retention of metrics.
3. High availability of components, including Prometheus.

## Getting Started

* **[Getting Started](https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/getting-started.md/)**
* [Design](https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/design.md/)
* [Blog posts](docs/getting-started.md#blog-posts)
* [Talks](docs/getting-started.md#talks)
* [Proposals](docs/proposals-done)
* [Integrations](docs/integrations.md)

## Features

* Global querying view across all connected Prometheus servers
* Deduplication and merging of metrics collected from Prometheus HA pairs
* Seamless integration with existing Prometheus setups
* Any object storage as its only, optional dependency
* Downsampling historical data for massive query speedup
* Cross-cluster federation
* Fault-tolerant query routing
* Simple gRPC "Store API" for unified data access across all metric data
* Easy integration points for custom metric providers

## Thanos Philosophy

The philosophy of Thanos and our community is borrowing much from UNIX philosophy and the golang programming language.

* Each subcommand should do one thing and do it well
  * e.g. thanos query proxies incoming calls to known store API endpoints merging the result
* Write components that work together
  * e.g. blocks should be stored in native prometheus format
* Make it easy to read, write, and, run components
  * e.g. reduce complexity in system design and implementation

## Releases

Main branch should be stable and usable. Every commit to main builds docker image named `main-<date>-<sha>` in [quay.io/thanos/thanos](https://quay.io/repository/thanos/thanos) and [thanosio/thanos dockerhub (mirror)](https://hub.docker.com/r/thanosio/thanos)

We also perform minor releases every 6 weeks.

During that, we build tarballs for major platforms and release docker images.

See [release process docs](docs/release-process.md) for details.
