# General

Thanos is an open source project and we value and welcome new contributors and members of the community. Here are ways to get in touch with the community:

## Thanos Community meeting

Thanos Community Meeting is a **public** and **recorded** monthly meeting every second Wednesday 12:00 UTC ([Time zone converter](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=12%3A00%20pm&tz=UTC%20(Coordinated%20Universal%20Time)&)).

Thanos maintainers & the community meet to discuss open issues, features and other Thanos related things.
Everyone is welcome to join & add items to the agenda. The meeting happens in Zoom. Right now meeting is in a Webinar format, where only small amount of people will have ability to speak and video share, due to recent [Zoombombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoombombing) issues.

* When: Monthly, every second Wednesday 12:00 UTC ([Time zone converter](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=12%3A00%20pm&tz=UTC%20(Coordinated%20Universal%20Time)&)).
