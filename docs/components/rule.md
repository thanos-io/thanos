# Rule (aka Ruler)

***NOTE:** It is recommended to keep deploying rules inside the relevant Prometheus servers locally. Use ruler only on specific cases. Read details [below](#risk) why.*

*The rule component should in particular not be used to circumvent solving rule deployment properly at the configuration management level.*

The `thanos rule` command evaluates Prometheus recording and alerting rules against chosen query API via repeated `--query` (or FileSD via `--query.sd`). If more than one query is passed, round robin balancing is performed.

By default, rule evaluation results are written back to disk in the Prometheus 2.0 storage format. Rule nodes at the same time participate in the system as source store nodes, which means that they expose StoreAPI and upload their generated TSDB blocks to an object store.

Rule also has a stateless mode which sends rule evaluation results to some remote storages via remote write for better scalability. This way, rule nodes only work as a data producer and the remote receive nodes work as source store nodes. It means that Thanos Rule in this mode does *not* expose the StoreAPI.

You can think of Rule as a simplified Prometheus that does not require a sidecar and does not scrape and do PromQL evaluation (no QueryAPI).

The data of each Rule node can be labeled to satisfy the clusters labeling scheme. High-availability pairs can be run in parallel and should be distinguished by the designated replica label, just like regular Prometheus servers. Read more about Ruler in HA [here](#ruler-ha)

```bash
thanos rule \
    --data-dir             "/path/to/data" \
    --eval-interval        "30s" \
    --rule-file            "/path/to/rules/*.rules.yaml" \
    --alert.query-url      "http://0.0.0.0:9090" \ # This tells what query URL to link to in UI.
    --alertmanagers.url    "http://alert.thanos.io" \
    --query                "query.example.org" \
    --query                "query2.example.org" \
    --objstore.config-file "bucket.yml" \
    --label                'monitor_cluster="cluster1"' \
    --label                'replica="A"'
```

## Risk

Ruler has conceptual tradeoffs that might not be favorable for most use cases. The main tradeoff is its dependence on query reliability. For Prometheus it is unlikely to have alert/recording rule evaluation failure as evaluation is local.

For Ruler the read path is distributed, since most likely Ruler is querying Thanos Querier which gets data from remote Store APIs.

This means that **query failure** are more likely to happen, that's why clear strategy on what will happen to alert and during query unavailability is the key.

## Configuring Rules

Rule files use YAML, the syntax of a rule file is:

```
groups:
  [ - <rule_group> ]
```

A simple example rules file would be:

```
groups:
  - name: example
    rules:
    - record: job:http_inprogress_requests:sum
      expr: sum(http_inprogress_requests) by (job)
```

<rule_group>

```
# The name of the group. Must be unique within a file.
name: <string>

# How often rules in the group are evaluated.
[ interval: <duration> | default = global.evaluation_interval ]

rules:
  [ - <rule> ... ]
```

Thanos supports two types of rules which may be configured and then evaluated at regular intervals: recording rules and alerting rules.

### Recording Rules

Recording rules allow you to precompute frequently needed or computationally expensive expressions and save their result as a new set of time series. Querying the precomputed result will then often be much faster than executing the original expression every time it is needed. This is especially useful for dashboards, which need to query the same expression repeatedly every time they refresh.

Recording and alerting rules exist in a rule group. Rules within a group are run sequentially at a regular interval.

The syntax for recording rules is:

```
# The name of the time series to output to. Must be a valid metric name.
record: <string>

# The PromQL expression to evaluate. Every evaluation cycle this is
# evaluated at the current time, and the result recorded as a new set of
# time series with the metric name as given by 'record'.
expr: <string>

# Labels to add or overwrite before storing the result.
labels:
  [ <labelname>: <labelvalue> ]
```

Note: If you make use of recording rules, make sure that you expose your Ruler instance as a store in the Thanos Querier so that the new time series can be queried as part of Thanos Query. One of the ways you can do this is by adding a new `--store <thanos-ruler-ip>` command-line argument to the Thanos Query command.

### Alerting Rules

The syntax for alerting rules is:

```
# The name of the alert. Must be a valid metric name.
alert: <string>

# The PromQL expression to evaluate. Every evaluation cycle this is
# evaluated at the current time, and all resultant time series become
# pending/firing alerts.
expr: <string>

# Alerts are considered firing once they have been returned for this long.
# Alerts which have not yet fired for long enough are considered pending.
[ for: <duration> | default = 0s ]

# Labels to add or overwrite for each alert.
labels:
  [ <labelname>: <tmpl_string> ]

# Annotations to add to each alert.
annotations:
  [ <labelname>: <tmpl_string> ]
```

## Partial Response

See [this](query.md#partial-response) on initial info.

Rule allows you to specify rule groups with additional fields that control PartialResponseStrategy e.g:

```yaml
groups:
- name: "warn strategy"
  partial_response_strategy: "warn"
  rules:
  - alert: "some"
    expr: "up"
- name: "abort strategy"
  partial_response_strategy: "abort"
  rules:
  - alert: "some"
    expr: "up"
- name: "by default strategy is abort"
  rules:
  - alert: "some"
    expr: "up"
```

It is recommended to keep partial response as `abort` for alerts and that is the default as well.

Essentially, for alerting, having partial response can result in symptoms being missed by Rule's alert.

## Must have: essential Ruler alerts!

To be sure that alerting works it is essential to monitor Ruler and alert from another **Scraper (Prometheus + sidecar)** that sits in same cluster.

The most important metrics to alert on are:

* `thanos_alert_sender_alerts_dropped_total`. If greater than 0, it means that alerts triggered by Rule are not being sent to alertmanager which might indicate connection, incompatibility or misconfiguration problems.

* `prometheus_rule_evaluation_failures_total`. If greater than 0, it means that that rule failed to be evaluated, which results in either gap in rule or potentially ignored alert. This metric might indicate problems on the queryAPI endpoint you use. Alert heavily on this if this happens for longer than your alert thresholds. `strategy` label will tell you if failures comes from rules that tolerate [partial response](#partial-response) or not.

* `prometheus_rule_group_last_duration_seconds > prometheus_rule_group_interval_seconds` If the difference is positive, it means that rule evaluation took more time than the scheduled interval, and data for some intervals could be missing. It can indicate that your query backend (e.g Querier) takes too much time to evaluate the query, i.e. that it is not fast enough to fill the rule. This might indicate other problems like slow StoreAPis or too complex query expression in rule.

* `thanos_rule_evaluation_with_warnings_total`. If you choose to use Rules and Alerts with [partial response strategy's](#partial-response) value as "warn", this metric will tell you how many evaluation ended up with some kind of warning. To see the actual warnings see WARN log level. This might suggest that those evaluations return partial response and might not be accurate.

Those metrics are important for vanilla Prometheus as well, but even more important when we rely on (sometimes WAN) network.

// TODO(bwplotka): Rereview them after recent changes in metrics.

See [alerts](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/blob/e3b0baf7de9dde1887253b1bb19d78ae71a01bf8/examples/alerts/alerts.md#ruler) for more example alerts for ruler.

NOTE: It is also recommended to set a mocked Alert on Ruler that checks if Query is up. This might be something simple like `vector(1)` query, just to check if Querier is live.

## Performance.

As rule nodes outsource query processing to query nodes, they should generally experience little load. If necessary, functional sharding can be applied by splitting up the sets of rules between HA pairs. Rules are processed with deduplicated data according to the replica label configured on query nodes.

## External labels

It is *mandatory* to add certain external labels to indicate the ruler origin (e.g `label='replica="A"'` or for `cluster`). Otherwise running multiple ruler replicas will be not possible, resulting in clash during compaction.

NOTE: It is advised to put different external labels than labels given by other sources we are recording or alerting against.

For example:

* Ruler is in cluster `mon1` and we have Prometheus in cluster `eu1`
* By default we could try having consistent labels so we have `cluster=eu1` for Prometheus and `cluster=mon1` for Ruler.
* We configure `ScraperIsDown` alert that monitors service from `work1` cluster.
* When triggered this alert results in `ScraperIsDown{cluster=mon1}` since external labels always *replace* source labels.

This effectively drops the important metadata and makes it impossible to tell in what exactly `cluster` the `ScraperIsDown` alert found problem without falling back to manual query.

## Ruler UI

On HTTP address Ruler exposes its UI that shows mainly Alerts and Rules page (similar to Prometheus Alerts page). Each alert is linked to the query that the alert is performing, which you can click to navigate to the configured `alert.query-url`.

## Ruler HA

Ruler aims to use a similar approach to the one that Prometheus has. You can configure external labels, as well as relabelling.

In case of Ruler in HA you need to make sure you have the following labelling setup:

* Labels that identify the HA group ruler and replica label with different value for each ruler instance, e.g: `cluster="eu1", replica="A"` and `cluster=eu1, replica="B"` by using `--label` flag.
* Labels that need to be dropped just before sending to alermanager in order for alertmanager to deduplicate alerts e.g `--alert.label-drop="replica"`.

Advanced relabelling configuration is possible with the `--alert.relabel-config` and `--alert.relabel-config-file` flags. The configuration format is identical to the [`alert_relabel_configs`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#alert_relabel_configs) field of Prometheus. Note that Thanos Ruler drops the labels listed in `--alert.label-drop` before alert relabelling.

## Stateless Ruler via Remote Write

Stateless ruler enables nearly indefinite horizontal scalability. Ruler doesn't have a fully functional TSDB for storing evaluation results, but uses a WAL only storage and sends data to some remote storage via remote write.

The WAL only storage reuses the upstream [Prometheus agent](https://prometheus.io/blog/2021/11/16/agent/) and it is compatible with the old TSDB data. For more design purpose of this mode, please refer to the [proposal](https://thanos.io/tip/proposals-done/202005-scalable-rule-storage.md/).

Stateless mode can be enabled by providing [Prometheus remote write config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write) in file via `--remote-write.config` or inlined `--remote-write.config-file` flag. For example:

```bash
thanos rule \
    --data-dir                  "/path/to/data" \
    --eval-interval             "30s" \
    --rule-file                 "/path/to/rules/*.rules.yaml" \
    --alert.query-url           "http://0.0.0.0:9090" \ # This tells what query URL to link to in UI.
    --alertmanagers.url         "http://alert.thanos.io" \
    --query                     "query.example.org" \
    --query                     "query2.example.org" \
    --objstore.config-file      "bucket.yml" \
    --label                     'monitor_cluster="cluster1"' \
    --label                     'replica="A"' \
    --remote-write.config-file  'rw-config.yaml'
```

Where `rw-config.yaml` could look as follows:

```yaml
remote_write:
- url: http://e2e_test_rule_remote_write-receive-1:8081/api/v1/receive
  name: thanos-receiver
  follow_redirects: false
- url: https://e2e_test_rule_remote_write-receive-2:443/api/v1/receive
  remote_timeout: 30s
  follow_redirects: true
  queue_config:
    capacity: 120000
    max_shards: 50
    min_shards: 1
    max_samples_per_send: 40000
    batch_send_deadline: 5s
    min_backoff: 5s
    max_backoff: 5m
```

You can pass this in file using `--remote-write.config-file=` or inline it using `--remote-write.config=`.

**NOTE:**
1. `metadata_config` is not supported in this mode and will be ignored if provided in the remote write configuration.
2. Ruler won't expose Store API for querying data if stateless mode is enabled. If the remote storage is thanos receiver then you can use that to query rule evaluation results.

                                 NOTE: For efficiency the limit is internally
                                 implemented as 'chunks limit' considering each
                                 chunk contains a maximum of 120 samples.
      --store.limits.request-series=0

      --tsdb.block-duration=2h   Block duration for TSDB block.
      --tsdb.no-lockfile         Do not create lockfile in TSDB data directory.
                                 In any case, the lockfiles will be deleted on
                                 next startup.
      --tsdb.retention=48h       Block retention time on local disk.
      --tsdb.wal-compression     Compress the tsdb WAL.
      --version                  Show application version.
      --web.disable-cors         Whether to disable CORS headers to be set by
                                 Thanos. By default Thanos sets CORS headers to
                                 be allowed by all.
      --web.external-prefix=""   Static prefix for all HTML links and redirect
                                 URLs in the bucket web UI interface.
                                 Actual endpoints are still served on / or the
                                 web.route-prefix. This allows thanos bucket
                                 web UI to be served behind a reverse proxy that
                                 strips a URL sub-path.
      --web.prefix-header=""     Name of HTTP request header used for dynamic
                                 prefixing of UI links and redirects.
                                 This option is ignored if web.external-prefix
                                 argument is set. Security risk: enable
                                 this option only if a reverse proxy in
                                 front of thanos is resetting the header.
                                 The --web.prefix-header=X-Forwarded-Prefix
                                 option can be useful, for example, if Thanos
                                 UI is served via Traefik reverse proxy with
                                 PathPrefixStrip option enabled, which sends the
                                 stripped prefix value in X-Forwarded-Prefix
                                 header. This allows thanos UI to be served on a
                                 sub-path.
      --web.route-prefix=""      Prefix for API and UI endpoints. This allows
                                 thanos UI to be served on a sub-path. This
                                 option is analogous to --web.route-prefix of
                                 Prometheus.

## Configuration

### Alertmanager

The `--alertmanagers.config` and `--alertmanagers.config-file` flags allow specifying multiple Alertmanagers. Those entries are treated as a single HA group. This means that alert send failure is claimed only if the Ruler fails to send to all instances.

The configuration format is the following:

```yaml
alertmanagers:
- http_config:
    basic_auth:
      username: ""
      password: ""
      password_file: ""
    bearer_token: ""
    bearer_token_file: ""
    proxy_url: ""
    tls_config:
      ca_file: ""
      cert_file: ""
      key_file: ""
      server_name: ""
      insecure_skip_verify: false
  static_configs: []
  file_sd_configs:
  - files: []
    refresh_interval: 0s
  scheme: http
  path_prefix: ""
  timeout: 10s
  api_version: v1
```

Supported values for `api_version` are `v1` or `v2`.

### Query API

The `--query.config` and `--query.config-file` flags allow specifying multiple query endpoints. Those entries are treated as a single HA group. This means that query failure is claimed only if the Ruler fails to query all instances.

The configuration format is the following:

```yaml
- http_config:
    basic_auth:
      username: ""
      password: ""
      password_file: ""
    bearer_token: ""
    bearer_token_file: ""
    proxy_url: ""
    tls_config:
      ca_file: ""
      cert_file: ""
      key_file: ""
      server_name: ""
      insecure_skip_verify: false
  static_configs: []
  file_sd_configs:
  - files: []
    refresh_interval: 0s
  scheme: http
  path_prefix: ""
```
