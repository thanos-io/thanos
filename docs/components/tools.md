# Tools

The `thanos tools` subcommand of Thanos is a set of additional CLI, short-living tools that are meant to be ran for development or debugging purposes.

All commands added as tools should land in `tools.go` or file with `tools_` prefix.

## Flags

```$ mdox-exec="thanos tools --help"
usage: thanos tools <command> [<args> ...]

Tools utility commands

Flags:
      --auto-gomemlimit.ratio=0.9
                                The ratio of reserved GOMEMLIMIT memory to the

      --enable-auto-gomemlimit  Enable go runtime to automatically limit memory
                                consumption.
  -h, --help                    Show context-sensitive help (also try

      --log.format=logfmt       Log format to use. Possible options: logfmt or
                                json.
      --log.level=info          Log filtering level.
      --tracing.config=<content>
                                Alternative to 'tracing.config-file' flag
                                (mutually exclusive). Content of YAML file
                                with tracing configuration. See format details:
                                https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/tracing.md/#configuration
      --tracing.config-file=<file-path>
                                Path to YAML file with tracing
                                configuration. See format details:
                                https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/tracing.md/#configuration
      --version                 Show application version.

Subcommands:
  tools bucket verify [<flags>]
    Verify all blocks in the bucket against specified issues. NOTE: Depending on
    issue this might take time and will need downloading all specified blocks to
    disk.

  tools bucket ls [<flags>]
    List all blocks in the bucket.

  tools bucket inspect [<flags>]
    Inspect all blocks in the bucket in detailed, table-like way.

  tools bucket web [<flags>]
    Web interface for remote storage bucket.

  tools bucket replicate [<flags>]
    Replicate data from one object storage to another. NOTE: Currently it works
    only with Thanos blocks (meta.json has to have Thanos metadata).

  tools bucket downsample [<flags>]
    Continuously downsamples blocks in an object store bucket.

  tools bucket cleanup [<flags>]
    Cleans up all blocks marked for deletion.

  tools bucket mark --id=ID --marker=MARKER [<flags>]
    Mark block for deletion or no-compact in a safe way. NOTE: If the compactor
    is currently running compacting same block, this operation would be
    potentially a noop.

  tools bucket rewrite --id=ID [<flags>]
    Rewrite chosen blocks in the bucket, while deleting or modifying
    series Resulted block has modified stats in meta.json. Additionally
    compaction.sources are altered to not confuse readers of meta.json.
    Instead thanos.rewrite section is added with useful info like old sources
    and deletion requests. NOTE: It's recommended to turn off compactor while
    doing this operation. If the compactor is running and touching exactly same
    block that is being rewritten, the resulted rewritten block might only cause
    overlap (mitigated by marking overlapping block manually for deletion) and
    the data you wanted to rewrite could already part of bigger block.

    Use FILESYSTEM type of bucket to rewrite block on disk (suitable for vanilla
    Prometheus) After rewrite, it's caller responsibility to delete or mark
    source block for deletion to avoid overlaps. WARNING: This procedure is
    *IRREVERSIBLE* after certain time (delete delay), so do backup your blocks
    first.

  tools bucket retention [<flags>]
    Retention applies retention policies on the given bucket. Please make sure
    no compactor is running on the same bucket at the same time.

  tools bucket upload-blocks [<flags>]
    Upload blocks push blocks from the provided path to the object storage.

  tools rules-check --rules=RULES
    Check if the rule files are valid or not.


```

## Bucket

The `thanos tools bucket` subcommand of Thanos is a set of commands to inspect data in object storage buckets. It is normally run as a standalone command to aid with troubleshooting.

Example:

```bash
thanos tools bucket verify --objstore.config-file=bucket.yml
```

The content of `bucket.yml`:

```yaml mdox-exec="go run scripts/cfggen/main.go --name=gcs.Config"
type: GCS
config:
  bucket: ""
  service_account: ""
  use_grpc: false
  grpc_conn_pool_size: 0
  http_config:
    idle_conn_timeout: 0s
    response_header_timeout: 0s
    insecure_skip_verify: false
    tls_handshake_timeout: 0s
    expect_continue_timeout: 0s
    max_idle_conns: 0
    max_idle_conns_per_host: 0
    max_conns_per_host: 0
    tls_config:
      ca_file: ""
      cert_file: ""
      key_file: ""
      server_name: ""
      insecure_skip_verify: false
    disable_compression: false
prefix: ""
```

Bucket can be extended to add more subcommands that will be helpful when working with object storage buckets by adding a new command within [`/cmd/thanos/tools_bucket.go`](../../cmd/thanos/tools_bucket.go)  .

      --web.disable-cors        Whether to disable CORS headers to be set by
                                Thanos. By default Thanos sets CORS headers to
                                be allowed by all.
      --web.external-prefix=""  Static prefix for all HTML links and redirect
                                URLs in the bucket web UI interface.
                                Actual endpoints are still served on / or the
                                web.route-prefix. This allows thanos bucket
                                web UI to be served behind a reverse proxy that
                                strips a URL sub-path.
      --web.prefix-header=""    Name of HTTP request header used for dynamic
                                prefixing of UI links and redirects.
                                This option is ignored if web.external-prefix
                                argument is set. Security risk: enable
                                this option only if a reverse proxy in
                                front of thanos is resetting the header.
                                The --web.prefix-header=X-Forwarded-Prefix
                                option can be useful, for example, if Thanos
                                UI is served via Traefik reverse proxy with
                                PathPrefixStrip option enabled, which sends the
                                stripped prefix value in X-Forwarded-Prefix
                                header. This allows thanos UI to be served on a
                                sub-path.
      --web.route-prefix=""     Prefix for API and UI endpoints. This allows
                                thanos UI to be served on a sub-path.
                                Defaults to the value of --web.external-prefix.
                                This option is analogous to --web.route-prefix
                                of Prometheus.

```

### Bucket Verify

`tools bucket verify` is used to verify and optionally repair blocks within the specified bucket.

Example:

```
thanos tools bucket verify --objstore.config-file="..."
```

When using the `--repair` option, make sure that the compactor job is disabled first.

```$ mdox-exec="thanos tools bucket verify --help"
usage: thanos tools bucket verify [<flags>]

Verify all blocks in the bucket against specified issues. NOTE: Depending on
issue this might take time and will need downloading all specified blocks to
disk.

Flags:
      --auto-gomemlimit.ratio=0.9
                                The ratio of reserved GOMEMLIMIT memory to the
                                detected maximum container or system memory.
      --delete-delay=0s         Duration after which blocks marked for deletion
                                would be deleted permanently from source bucket
                                by compactor component. If delete-delay is
                                non zero, blocks will be marked for deletion
                                and compactor component is required to delete

### Bucket downsample

`tools bucket downsample` is used to downsample blocks in an object store bucket as a service. It implements the downsample API on top of historical data in an object storage bucket.

```bash
thanos tools bucket downsample \
    --data-dir        "/local/state/data/dir" \
    --objstore.config-file "bucket.yml"
```

The content of `bucket.yml`:

```yaml mdox-exec="go run scripts/cfggen/main.go --name=gcs.Config"

### Bucket mark

`tools bucket mark` can be used to manually mark block for deletion.

NOTE: If the [Compactor](compact.md) is currently running and compacting exactly same block, this operation would be potentially a noop."

```bash
thanos tools bucket mark \
    --id "01C8320GCGEWBZF51Q46TTQEH9" --id "01C8J352831FXGZQMN2NTJ08DY"
    --objstore.config-file "bucket.yml"
```

```

### Bucket Rewrite

`tools bucket rewrite` rewrites chosen blocks in the bucket, while deleting or modifying series.

For example we can remove all non counters from the block you have on your disk (e.g in Prometheus dir):

```bash
thanos tools bucket rewrite --no-dry-run \
  --id 01DN3SK96XDAEKRB1AN30AAW6E \
  --objstore.config "
type: FILESYSTEM
config:
  directory: <local dir>
" \
  --rewrite.to-delete-config "
- matchers: \"{__name__!~\\\".*total\\\"}\"
"
```

By default, rewrite also produces `change.log` in the tmp local dir. Look for log message like:

```
ts=2020-11-09T00:40:13.703322181Z caller=level.go:63 level=info msg="changelog will be available" file=/tmp/thanos-rewrite/01EPN74E401ZD2SQXS4SRY6DZX/change.log`
```

```$ mdox-exec="thanos tools bucket rewrite --help"
usage: thanos tools bucket rewrite --id=ID [<flags>]

Rewrite chosen blocks in the bucket, while deleting or modifying series Resulted
block has modified stats in meta.json. Additionally compaction.sources are
altered to not confuse readers of meta.json. Instead thanos.rewrite section
is added with useful info like old sources and deletion requests. NOTE: It's
recommended to turn off compactor while doing this operation. If the compactor
is running and touching exactly same block that is being rewritten, the resulted
rewritten block might only cause overlap (mitigated by marking overlapping block
manually for deletion) and the data you wanted to rewrite could already part of
bigger block.

Use FILESYSTEM type of bucket to rewrite block on disk (suitable for vanilla
Prometheus) After rewrite, it's caller responsibility to delete or mark source
block for deletion to avoid overlaps. WARNING: This procedure is *IRREVERSIBLE*
after certain time (delete delay), so do backup your blocks first.

Flags:

## Rules-check

The `tools rules-check` subcommand contains tools for validation of Prometheus rules.

This is allowing to check the rules with the same validation as is used by the Thanos Ruler node.

NOTE: The check is equivalent to the `promtool check rules` with addition of Thanos Ruler extended rules file syntax, which includes `partial_response_strategy` field which `promtool` does not allow.

If the check fails the command fails with exit code `1`, otherwise `0`.

Example:

```
./thanos tools rules-check --rules cmd/thanos/testdata/rules-files/*.yaml
```

```$ mdox-exec="thanos tools rules-check --help"
usage: thanos tools rules-check --rules=RULES

Check if the rule files are valid or not.

Flags:
      --auto-gomemlimit.ratio=0.9
                                The ratio of reserved GOMEMLIMIT memory to the
                                detected maximum container or system memory.
      --enable-auto-gomemlimit  Enable go runtime to automatically limit memory
                                consumption.
  -h, --help                    Show context-sensitive help (also try
                                --help-long and --help-man).
      --log.format=logfmt       Log format to use. Possible options: logfmt or
                                json.
      --log.level=info          Log filtering level.
      --rules=RULES ...         The rule files glob to check (repeated).

#### Probes

- The downsample service exposes two endpoints for probing:
  - `/-/healthy` starts as soon as the initial setup is completed.
  - `/-/ready` starts after all the bootstrapping completed (e.g object store bucket connection) and ready to serve traffic.

> NOTE: Metric endpoint starts immediately so, make sure you set up readiness probe on designated HTTP `/-/ready` path.
