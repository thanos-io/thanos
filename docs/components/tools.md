# Tools

The `thanos tools` subcommand of Thanos is a set of additional CLI, short-living tools that are meant to be ran for development or debugging purposes.

All commands added as tools should land in `tools.go` or file with `tools_` prefix.

```

## Bucket

The `thanos tools bucket` subcommand of Thanos is a set of commands to inspect data in object storage buckets. It is normally run as a standalone command to aid with troubleshooting.

Example:

```bash
thanos tools bucket verify --objstore.config-file=bucket.yml
```

The content of `bucket.yml`:

```yaml
type: GCS
config:
  bucket: example-bucket
```

Bucket can be extended to add more subcommands that will be helpful when working with object storage buckets by adding a new command within [`/cmd/thanos/tools_bucket.go`](../../cmd/thanos/tools_bucket.go)  .

Example:

```
thanos tools bucket web --objstore.config-file="..."
```

```$
usage: thanos tools bucket web [<flags>]

Flags:
  -h, --help                    Show context-sensitive help (also try
                                --help-long and --help-man).

                                See format details:
                                https://thanos.io/tracing.md/#configuration
      --tracing.config=<content>
                                Alternative to 'tracing.config-file' flag (lower
                                priority). Content of YAML file with tracing
                                configuration. See format details:
                                https://thanos.io/tracing.md/#configuration
      --objstore.config-file=<file-path>
                                Path to YAML file that contains object store
                                configuration. See format details:
                                https://thanos.io/storage.md/#configuration
      --objstore.config=<content>
                                Alternative to 'objstore.config-file' flag
                                (lower priority). Content of YAML file that
                                contains object store configuration. See format
                                details:
                                https://thanos.io/storage.md/#configuration
      --http-address="0.0.0.0:10902"
                                Listen host:port for HTTP endpoints.
      --http-grace-period=2m    Time to wait after an interrupt received for
                                HTTP Server.
      --web.external-prefix=""  Static prefix for all HTML links and redirect
                                URLs in the bucket web UI interface. Actual
                                endpoints are still served on / or the
                                web.route-prefix. This allows thanos bucket web
                                UI to be served behind a reverse proxy that
                                strips a URL sub-path.
      --web.prefix-header=""    Name of HTTP request header used for dynamic
                                prefixing of UI links and redirects. This option
                                is ignored if web.external-prefix argument is
                                set. Security risk: enable this option only if a
                                reverse proxy in front of thanos is resetting
                                the header. The
                                --web.prefix-header=X-Forwarded-Prefix option
                                can be useful, for example, if Thanos UI is
                                served via Traefik reverse proxy with
                                PathPrefixStrip option enabled, which sends the
                                stripped prefix value in X-Forwarded-Prefix
                                header. This allows thanos UI to be served on a
                                sub-path.
      --refresh=30m             Refresh interval to download metadata from
                                remote storage
      --timeout=5m              Timeout to download metadata from remote storage
      --label=LABEL             Prometheus label to use as timeline title

```

### Bucket Verify

                           Alternative to 'objstore.config-file' flag (lower
                           priority). Content of YAML file that contains object
                           store configuration. See format details:
                           https://thanos.io/storage.md/#configuration

                           Path to YAML file that contains object store-backup
                           configuration. See format details:
                           https://thanos.io/storage.md/#configuration Used for
                           repair logic to backup blocks before removal.
      --objstore-backup.config=<content>
                           Alternative to 'objstore-backup.config-file' flag
                           (lower priority). Content of YAML file that contains
                           object store-backup configuration. See format
                           details: https://thanos.io/storage.md/#configuration
                           Used for repair logic to backup blocks before
                           removal.
  -r, --repair             Attempt to repair blocks for which issues were
                           detected
  -i, --issues=index_issue... ...
                           Issues to verify (and optionally repair). Possible
                           values: [duplicated_compaction index_issue
                           overlapped_blocks]
      --id=ID ...          Block IDs to verify (and optionally repair) only. If
                           none is specified, all blocks will be verified.
                           Repeated field
      --delete-delay=0s    Duration after which blocks marked for deletion would
                           be deleted permanently from source bucket by
                           compactor component. If delete-delay is non zero,
                           blocks will be marked for deletion and compactor
                           component is required to delete blocks from source
                           bucket. If delete-delay is 0, blocks will be deleted
                           straight away. Use this if you want to get rid of or
                           move the block immediately. Note that deleting blocks
                           immediately can cause query failures, if store
                           gateway still has the block loaded, or compactor is
                           ignoring the deletion because it's compacting the
                           block at the same time.

```

### Bucket ls

```

### Bucket replicate

`bucket tools replicate` is used to replicate buckets from one object storage to another.

NOTE: Currently it works only with Thanos blocks (meta.json has to have Thanos metadata).

```

```$
usage: thanos tools bucket replicate [<flags>]

Replicate data from one object storage to another. NOTE: Currently it works only
with Thanos blocks (meta.json has to have Thanos metadata).

### Bucket downsample

`tools bucket downsample` is used to continuously downsample blocks in an object store bucket as a service. It implements the downsample API on top of historical data in an object storage bucket.

```bash
thanos tools bucket downsample \
    --data-dir        "/local/state/data/dir" \
    --objstore.config-file "bucket.yml"
```

The content of `bucket.yml`:

```yaml
type: GCS
config:
  bucket: example-bucket
```

```$
usage: thanos tools bucket downsample [<flags>]

continuously downsamples blocks in an object store bucket

## Rules-check

The `tools rules-check` subcommand contains tools for validation of Prometheus rules.

This is allowing to check the rules with the same validation as is used by the Thanos rule node.

NOTE: The check is equivalent to the `promtool check rules` with addition of Thanos rule extended rules file syntax, which includes `partial_response_strategy` field which `promtool` does not allow.

If the check fails the command fails with exit code `1`, otherwise `0`.

Example:

```
./thanos tools rules-check --rules cmd/thanos/testdata/rules-files/*.yaml
```

```$
usage: thanos tools rules-check --rules=RULES

Check if the rule files are valid or not.

Flags:
  -h, --help               Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and
                           --help-man).

      --log.level=info     Log filtering level.

                           configuration. See format details:
                           https://thanos.io/tracing.md/#configuration
      --rules=RULES ...    The rule files glob to check (repeated).

```

#### Probes

- The downsample service exposes two endpoints for probing:
  - `/-/healthy` starts as soon as initial setup completed.
  - `/-/ready` starts after all the bootstrapping completed (e.g object store bucket connection) and ready to serve traffic.

> NOTE: Metric endpoint starts immediately so, make sure you set up readiness probe on designated HTTP `/-/ready` path.
