# Tools

The `thanos tools` subcommand of Thanos is a set of additional CLI, short-living tools that
are meant to be ran for development or debugging purposes.

All commands added as tools should land in `tools.go` or file with `tools_` prefix.

## Flags

[embedmd]:# (flags/tools.txt $)
```$
usage: thanos tools <command> [<args> ...]

Tools utility commands

Flags:
  -h, --help               Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and
                           --help-man).
      --version            Show application version.
      --log.level=info     Log filtering level.
      --log.format=logfmt  Log format to use. Possible options: logfmt or json.
      --tracing.config-file=<file-path>
                           Path to YAML file with tracing configuration. See
                           format details:
                           https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/tracing.md/#configuration
      --tracing.config=<content>
                           Alternative to 'tracing.config-file' flag (lower
                           priority). Content of YAML file with tracing
                           configuration. See format details:
                           https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/tracing.md/#configuration

Subcommands:
  tools bucket verify [<flags>]
    Verify all blocks in the bucket against specified issues. NOTE: Depending on
    issue this might take time and will need downloading all specified blocks to
    disk.

  tools bucket ls [<flags>]
    List all blocks in the bucket.

  tools bucket inspect [<flags>]
    Inspect all blocks in the bucket in detailed, table-like way.

  tools bucket web [<flags>]
    Web interface for remote storage bucket.

  tools bucket replicate [<flags>]
    Replicate data from one object storage to another. NOTE: Currently it works
    only with Thanos blocks (meta.json has to have Thanos metadata).

  tools bucket downsample [<flags>]
    Continuously downsamples blocks in an object store bucket.

  tools bucket cleanup [<flags>]
    Cleans up all blocks marked for deletion.

  tools bucket mark --id=ID --marker=MARKER --details=DETAILS
    Mark block for deletion or no-compact in a safe way. NOTE: If the compactor
    is currently running compacting same block, this operation would be
    potentially a noop.

  tools bucket rewrite --id=ID [<flags>]
    Rewrite chosen blocks in the bucket, while deleting or modifying series
    Resulted block has modified stats in meta.json. Additionally
    compaction.sources are altered to not confuse readers of meta.json. Instead
    thanos.rewrite section is added with useful info like old sources and
    deletion requests. NOTE: It's recommended to turn off compactor while doing
    this operation. If the compactor is running and touching exactly same block
    that is being rewritten, the resulted rewritten block might only cause
    overlap (mitigated by marking overlapping block manually for deletion) and
    the data you wanted to rewrite could already part of bigger block.

    Use FILESYSTEM type of bucket to rewrite block on disk (suitable for vanilla
    Prometheus) After rewrite, it's caller responsibility to delete or mark
    source block for deletion to avoid overlaps. WARNING: This procedure is
    *IRREVERSIBLE* after certain time (delete delay), so do backup your blocks
    first.

  tools rules-check --rules=RULES
    Check if the rule files are valid or not.


```

## Bucket

The `thanos tools bucket` subcommand of Thanos is a set of commands to inspect data in object storage buckets.
It is normally run as a standalone command to aid with troubleshooting.

Example:

```bash
thanos tools bucket verify --objstore.config-file=bucket.yml
```

The content of `bucket.yml`:

```yaml
type: GCS
config:
  bucket: example-bucket
```

Bucket can be extended to add more subcommands that will be helpful when working with object storage buckets
by adding a new command within [`/cmd/thanos/tools_bucket.go`](/cmd/thanos/tools_bucket.go)  .

### Bucket Web

`tools bucket web` is used to inspect bucket blocks in form of interactive web UI.

This will start local webserver that will periodically update the view with given refresh.

<img src="../img/bucket-web.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="web" />

Example:

```
thanos tools bucket web --objstore.config-file="..."
```

[embedmd]:# (flags/tools_bucket_web.txt $)
```$
usage: thanos tools bucket web [<flags>]

Web interface for remote storage bucket.

Flags:
  -h, --help                    Show context-sensitive help (also try
                                --help-long and --help-man).
      --version                 Show application version.
      --log.level=info          Log filtering level.
      --log.format=logfmt       Log format to use. Possible options: logfmt or
                                json.
      --tracing.config-file=<file-path>
                                Path to YAML file with tracing configuration.
                                See format details:
                                https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/tracing.md/#configuration
      --tracing.config=<content>
                                Alternative to 'tracing.config-file' flag (lower
                                priority). Content of YAML file with tracing
                                configuration. See format details:
                                https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/tracing.md/#configuration
      --objstore.config-file=<file-path>
                                Path to YAML file that contains object store
                                configuration. See format details:
                                https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/storage.md/#configuration
      --objstore.config=<content>
                                Alternative to 'objstore.config-file' flag
                                (lower priority). Content of YAML file that
                                contains object store configuration. See format
                                details:
                                https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/storage.md/#configuration
      --http-address="0.0.0.0:10902"
                                Listen host:port for HTTP endpoints.
      --http-grace-period=2m    Time to wait after an interrupt received for
                                HTTP Server.
      --web.external-prefix=""  Static prefix for all HTML links and redirect
                                URLs in the bucket web UI interface. Actual
                                endpoints are still served on / or the
                                web.route-prefix. This allows thanos bucket web
                                UI to be served behind a reverse proxy that
                                strips a URL sub-path.
      --web.prefix-header=""    Name of HTTP request header used for dynamic
                                prefixing of UI links and redirects. This option
                                is ignored if web.external-prefix argument is
                                set. Security risk: enable this option only if a
                                reverse proxy in front of thanos is resetting
                                the header. The
                                --web.prefix-header=X-Forwarded-Prefix option
                                can be useful, for example, if Thanos UI is
                                served via Traefik reverse proxy with
                                PathPrefixStrip option enabled, which sends the
                                stripped prefix value in X-Forwarded-Prefix
                                header. This allows thanos UI to be served on a
                                sub-path.
      --refresh=30m             Refresh interval to download metadata from
                                remote storage
      --timeout=5m              Timeout to download metadata from remote storage
      --label=LABEL             Prometheus label to use as timeline title

```

### Bucket Verify

`tools bucket verify` is used to verify and optionally repair blocks within the specified bucket.

Example:

```
thanos tools bucket verify --objstore.config-file="..."
```

When using the `--repair` option, make sure that the compactor job is disabled first.

[embedmd]:# (flags/tools_bucket_verify.txt $)
```$
usage: thanos tools bucket verify [<flags>]

issue this might take time and will need downloading all specified blocks to
disk.

Flags:

                           Alternative to 'objstore.config-file' flag (lower
                           priority). Content of YAML file that contains object
                           store configuration. See format details:
                           https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/storage.md/#configuration

                           Used for repair logic to backup blocks before
                           removal.
      --objstore-backup.config=<content>
                           Alternative to 'objstore-backup.config-file' flag
                           (lower priority). Content of YAML file that contains
                           object store-backup configuration. See format
                           details:

                           removal.
  -r, --repair             Attempt to repair blocks for which issues were
                           detected
  -i, --issues=index_known_issues... ...
                           Issues to verify (and optionally repair). Possible
                           issue to verify, without repair: [overlapped_blocks];
                           Possible issue to verify and repair:
                           [index_known_issues duplicated_compaction]
      --id=ID ...          Block IDs to verify (and optionally repair) only. If
                           none is specified, all blocks will be verified.
                           Repeated field
      --delete-delay=0s    Duration after which blocks marked for deletion would
                           be deleted permanently from source bucket by
                           compactor component. If delete-delay is non zero,
                           blocks will be marked for deletion and compactor
                           component is required to delete blocks from source
                           bucket. If delete-delay is 0, blocks will be deleted
                           straight away. Use this if you want to get rid of or
                           move the block immediately. Note that deleting blocks
                           immediately can cause query failures, if store
                           gateway still has the block loaded, or compactor is
                           ignoring the deletion because it's compacting the
                           block at the same time.

```

### Bucket replicate

`bucket tools replicate` is used to replicate buckets from one object storage to another.

NOTE: Currently it works only with Thanos blocks (meta.json has to have Thanos metadata).

Example:
```
thanos tools bucket replicate --objstore.config-file="..." --objstore-to.config="..."
```

[embedmd]:# (flags/tools_bucket_replicate.txt $)

### Bucket mark

`tools bucket mark` can be used to manually mark block for deletion.

NOTE: If the [Compactor](compact.md) is currently running and compacting exactly same block, this operation would be potentially a noop."

```bash

      --details=DETAILS    Human readable details to be put into marker.

```

### Bucket Rewrite

`tools bucket rewrite` reewrites chosen blocks in the bucket, while deleting or modifying series.

For example we can remove all non counters from the block you have on your disk (e.g in Prometheus dir):

```bash
thanos tools bucket rewrite --no-dry-run \
  --id 01DN3SK96XDAEKRB1AN30AAW6E \
  --objstore.config "
type: FILESYSTEM
config:
  directory: <local dir>
" \
  --rewrite.to-delete-config "
- matchers: \"{__name__!~\\\".*total\\\"}\"
"
```

By default, rewrite also produces `change.log` in the tmp local dir. Look for log message like:

```
ts=2020-11-09T00:40:13.703322181Z caller=level.go:63 level=info msg="changelog will be available" file=/tmp/thanos-rewrite/01EPN74E401ZD2SQXS4SRY6DZX/change.log`
```

[embedmd]:# (flags/tools_bucket_rewrite.txt $)
```$
usage: thanos tools bucket rewrite --id=ID [<flags>]

Rewrite chosen blocks in the bucket, while deleting or modifying series Resulted
block has modified stats in meta.json. Additionally compaction.sources are
altered to not confuse readers of meta.json. Instead thanos.rewrite section is
added with useful info like old sources and deletion requests. NOTE: It's
recommended to turn off compactor while doing this operation. If the compactor
is running and touching exactly same block that is being rewritten, the resulted
rewritten block might only cause overlap (mitigated by marking overlapping block
manually for deletion) and the data you wanted to rewrite could already part of
bigger block.

Use FILESYSTEM type of bucket to rewrite block on disk (suitable for vanilla
Prometheus) After rewrite, it's caller responsibility to delete or mark source
block for deletion to avoid overlaps. WARNING: This procedure is *IRREVERSIBLE*
after certain time (delete delay), so do backup your blocks first.

## Rules-check

The `tools rules-check` subcommand contains tools for validation of Prometheus rules.

This is allowing to check the rules with the same validation as is used by the Thanos Ruler node.

NOTE: The check is equivalent to the `promtool check rules` with addition of Thanos Ruler extended rules file syntax,
which includes `partial_response_strategy` field which `promtool` does not allow.

If the check fails the command fails with exit code `1`, otherwise `0`.

Example:

```
./thanos tools rules-check --rules cmd/thanos/testdata/rules-files/*.yaml
```

[embedmd]:# (flags/tools_rules-check.txt $)
```$
usage: thanos tools rules-check --rules=RULES

Check if the rule files are valid or not.

Flags:
  -h, --help               Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and
                           --help-man).
      --version            Show application version.
      --log.level=info     Log filtering level.
      --log.format=logfmt  Log format to use. Possible options: logfmt or json.
      --tracing.config-file=<file-path>
                           Path to YAML file with tracing configuration. See
                           format details:
                           https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/tracing.md/#configuration
      --tracing.config=<content>
                           Alternative to 'tracing.config-file' flag (lower
                           priority). Content of YAML file with tracing
                           configuration. See format details:
                           https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/tracing.md/#configuration
      --rules=RULES ...    The rule files glob to check (repeated).

```

#### Probes

- The downsample service exposes two endpoints for probing:
  - `/-/healthy` starts as soon as initial setup completed.
  - `/-/ready` starts after all the bootstrapping completed (e.g object store bucket connection) and ready to serve traffic.

> NOTE: Metric endpoint starts immediately so, make sure you set up readiness probe on designated HTTP `/-/ready` path.
