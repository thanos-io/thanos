# Query Frontend

The `thanos query-frontend` command implements a service that can be put in front of Thanos Queriers to improve the read path. It is
based on the [Cortex Query Frontend](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/architecture/#query-frontend) component so you can find some common features like `Splitting` and `Results Caching`.

Query Frontend is fully stateless and horizontally scalable.

Example command to run Query Frontend:

```bash
thanos query-frontend \
    --http-address     "0.0.0.0:9090" \
    --query-frontend.downstream-url="<thanos-querier>:<querier-http-port>"
```

_**NOTE:** Currently only range queries (`/api/v1/query_range` API call) are actually processed through Query Frontend. All other
API calls just directly go to the downstream Querier, which means only range queries are split and cached. But we are planning to support instant queries as well.

For more information please check out [initial design proposal](https://thanos.io/tip/proposals/202004_embedd_cortex_frontend.md/).

## Features

### Splitting

Query Frontend splits a long query into multiple short queries based on the configured `--query-range.split-interval` flag. The default value of `--query-range.split-interval`
is `24h`. When caching is enabled it should be greater than `0`.

There are some benefits from query splitting:

1. Safe guard. It prevents large queries from causing OOM issues to Queries.
2. Better parallelization.
3. Better load balancing for Queries.

### Retry

Query Frontend supports a retry mechanism to retry query when HTTP requests are failing. There is a `--query-range.max-retries-per-request` flag to limit the maximum retry times.

### Caching

Query Frontend supports caching query results and reuses them on subsequent queries. If the cached results are incomplete,
Query Frontend calculates the required subqueries and executes them in parallel on downstream queriers.
Query Frontend can optionally align queries with their step parameter to improve the cacheability of the query results.
Currently, in-memory cache (fifo cache) and memcached are supported.

#### In-memory

[embedmd]:# (../flags/config_response_cache_in_memory.txt yaml)
```yaml
type: IN-MEMORY
config:
  max_size: ""
  max_size_items: 0
  validity: 0s
```
`max_size: ` Maximum memory size of the cache in bytes. A unit suffix (KB, MB, GB) may be applied.

**_NOTE:** If both `max_size` and `max_size_items` are not set, then the *cache* would not be created.

If either of `max_size` or `max_size_items` is set, then there is not limit on other field.
For example - only set `max_size_item` to 1000, then `max_size` is unlimited. Similarly, if only `max_size` is set, then `max_size_items` is unlimited.

Example configuration: [kube-thanos](https://github.com/thanos-io/kube-thanos/blob/master/examples/all/manifests/thanos-query-frontend-deployment.yaml#L50-L54)

#### Memcached

[embedmd]:# (../flags/config_response_cache_memcached.txt yaml)
```yaml
type: MEMCACHED
config:
  addresses: []
  timeout: 0s
  max_idle_connections: 0
  max_async_concurrency: 0
  max_async_buffer_size: 0
  max_get_multi_concurrency: 0
  max_item_size: 0
  max_get_multi_batch_size: 0
  dns_provider_update_interval: 0s
  expiration: 0s
```

`expiration` specifies memcached cache valid time , If set to 0s, so using a default of 24 hours expiration time

Other cache configuration parameters, you can refer to [memcached-index-cache]( https://thanos.io/tip/components/store.md/#memcached-index-cache).

The default memcached config is:

```yaml
type: MEMCACHED
config:
  addresses: [your-memcached-addresses]
  timeout: 500ms
  max_idle_connections: 100
  max_async_concurrency: 10
  max_async_buffer_size: 10000
  max_get_multi_concurrency: 100
  max_get_multi_batch_size: 0
  dns_provider_update_interval: 10s
  expiration: 24h
```

### Slow Query Log

Query Frontend supports `--query-frontend.log-queries-longer-than` flag to log queries running longer than some duration.

## Naming

Naming is hard :) Please check [here](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2434#discussion_r408300683) to see why we chose `query-frontend` as the name.
