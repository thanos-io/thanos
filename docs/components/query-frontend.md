# Query Frontend

The `thanos query-frontend` command implements a service that can be put in front of Thanos Queriers to improve the read path. It is based on the [Cortex Query Frontend](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/architecture/#query-frontend) component so you can find some common features like `Splitting` and `Results Caching`.

Query Frontend is fully stateless and horizontally scalable.

Example command to run Query Frontend:

```bash
thanos query-frontend \
    --http-address     "http://0.0.0.0:9090" \
    --query-frontend.downstream-url="<thanos-querier>:<querier-http-port>"
```

_**NOTE:** Currently only range queries (`/api/v1/query_range` API call) are actually processed through Query Frontend. All other API calls just directly go to the downstream Querier, which means only range queries are split and cached. But we are planning to support instant queries as well.

For more information please check out [initial design proposal](https://thanos.io/tip/proposals-done/202004-embedd-cortex-frontend.md/).

## Features

### Splitting

Query Frontend splits a long query into multiple short queries based on the configured `--query-range.split-interval` flag. The default value of `--query-range.split-interval` is `24h`. Set it to `0` disables query splitting, but please note that caching is also disabled in this case.

There are some benefits from query splitting:

1. Safe guard. It prevents large queries from causing OOM issues to Queries.
2. Better parallelization.
3. Better load balancing for Queries.

### Retry

Query Frontend supports a retry mechanism to retry query when HTTP requests are failing. There is a `--query-range.max-retries-per-request` flag to limit the maximum retry times.

### Caching

Query Frontend supports caching query results and reuses them on subsequent queries. If the cached results are incomplete, Query Frontend calculates the required subqueries and executes them in parallel on downstream queriers. Query Frontend can optionally align queries with their step parameter to improve the cacheability of the query results.

Currently, only in-memory cache (fifo cache) is supported. An example config:

```yaml
type: IN-MEMORY
config:
  max_size: ""
  max_size_items: 0
  validity: 0s
```

### Slow Query Log

Query Frontend supports `--query-frontend.log_queries_longer_than` flag to log queries running longer some duration.

## Naming

Naming is hard :) Please check [here](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/2434#discussion_r408300683) to see why we chose `query-frontend` as the name.

      --tracing.config=<content>
                              Alternative to 'tracing.config-file' flag (lower

                              configuration. See format details:
                              https://thanos.io/tip/tracing.md/#configuration
      --query-range.split-interval=24h
                              Split queries by an interval and execute in
                              parallel, 0 disables it.
      --query-range.max-retries-per-request=5
                              Maximum number of retries for a single request;
                              beyond this, the downstream error is returned.
      --query-range.max-query-length=0
                              Limit the query time range (end - start time) in
