# Querier/Query

The `thanos query` command (also known as "Querier") implements the [Prometheus HTTP v1 API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/) to query data in a Thanos cluster via PromQL.

In short, it gathers the data needed to evaluate the query from underlying [StoreAPIs](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/blob/main/pkg/store/storepb/rpc.proto), evaluates the query and returns the result.

Querier is fully stateless and horizontally scalable.

Example command to run Querier:

```bash
thanos query \
    --http-address     "0.0.0.0:9090" \
    --endpoint         "<store-api>:<grpc-port>" \
    --endpoint         "<store-api2>:<grpc-port>"
```

## Querier use cases, why do I need this component?

Thanos Querier essentially allows to aggregate and optionally deduplicate multiple metrics backends under single Prometheus Query endpoint.

### Global View

Since for Querier "a backend" is anything that implements gRPC StoreAPI we can aggregate data from any number of the different storages like:

* Prometheus (see [Sidecar](sidecar.md))
* Object Storage (see [Store Gateway](store.md))
* Global alerting/recording rules evaluations (see [Ruler](rule.md))
* Metrics received from Prometheus remote write streams (see [Receiver](receive.md))
* Another Querier (you can stack Queriers on top of each other)
* Non-Prometheus systems!
  * e.g [OpenTSDB](../integrations.md#opentsdb-as-storeapi)

Thanks to that, you can run queries (manually, from Grafana or via Alerting rule) that aggregate metrics from mix of those sources.

Some examples:

* `sum(cpu_used{cluster=~"cluster-(eu1|eu2|eu3|us1|us2|us3)", job="service1"})` that will give you sum of CPU used inside all listed clusters for service `service1`. This will work even if those clusters runs multiple Prometheus servers each. Querier will know which data sources to query.

* In single cluster you shard Prometheus functionally or have different Prometheus instances for different tenants. You can spin up Querier to have access to both within single Query evaluation.

### Run-time deduplication of HA groups

Prometheus is stateful and does not allow replicating its database. This means that increasing high availability by running multiple Prometheus replicas is not very easy to use. Simple load balancing will not work as for example after some crash, replica might be up but querying such replica will result in small gap during the period it was down. You have a second replica that maybe was up, but it could be down in other moment (e.g rolling restart), so load balancing on top of those is not working well.

Thanos Querier instead pulls the data from both replicas, and deduplicate those signals, filling the gaps if any, transparently to the Querier consumer.

## Metric Query Flow Overview

<img src="../img/querier.svg" class="img-fluid" alt="querier-steps"/>

Overall QueryAPI exposed by Thanos is guaranteed to be compatible with [Prometheus 2.x. API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/). The above diagram shows what Querier does for each Prometheus query request.

See [here](../service-discovery.md) on how to connect Querier with desired StoreAPIs.

### Deduplication

The query layer can deduplicate series that were collected from high-availability pairs of data sources such as Prometheus. A fixed single or multiple replica labels must be chosen for the entire cluster and can then be passed to query nodes on startup.

Two or more series that are only distinguished by the given replica label, will be merged into a single time series. This also hides gaps in collection of a single data source.

### An example with a single replica labels:

* Prometheus + sidecar "A": `cluster=1,env=2,replica=A`
* Prometheus + sidecar "B": `cluster=1,env=2,replica=B`
* Prometheus + sidecar "A" in different cluster: `cluster=2,env=2,replica=A`

If we configure Querier like this:

```
thanos query \
    --http-address        "0.0.0.0:9090" \
    --query.replica-label "replica" \
    --endpoint            "<store-api>:<grpc-port>" \
    --endpoint            "<store-api2>:<grpc-port>" \
```

And we query for metric `up{job="prometheus",env="2"}` with this option we will get 2 results:

* `up{job="prometheus",env="2",cluster="1"} 1`
* `up{job="prometheus",env="2",cluster="2"} 1`

WITHOUT this replica flag (deduplication turned off), we will get 3 results:

* `up{job="prometheus",env="2",cluster="1",replica="A"} 1`
* `up{job="prometheus",env="2",cluster="1",replica="B"} 1`
* `up{job="prometheus",env="2",cluster="2",replica="A"} 1`

### The same output will be present for this example with multiple replica labels:

* Prometheus + sidecar "A": `cluster=1,env=2,replica=A,replicaX=A`
* Prometheus + sidecar "B": `cluster=1,env=2,replica=B,replicaX=B`
* Prometheus + sidecar "A" in different cluster: `cluster=2,env=2,replica=A,replicaX=A`

```
thanos query \
    --http-address        "0.0.0.0:9090" \
    --query.replica-label "replica" \
    --query.replica-label "replicaX" \
    --endpoint            "<store-api>:<grpc-port>" \
    --endpoint            "<store-api2>:<grpc-port>" \
```

This logic can also be controlled via parameter on QueryAPI. More details below.

### Deduplication on non-external labels

In `v0.31.0` we have implemented an [optimization](../proposals-accepted/20221129-avoid-global-sort.md) which broke deduplication on non-external labels. We think that it was just a coincidence that deduplication worked at all on non-external labels in previous versions.

External labels always override any labels a series might have and this makes it so that it is possible to remove replica labels on series returned by a StoreAPI as an optimization. If deduplication happens on internal labels then that might lead to unsorted series from a StoreAPI and that breaks deduplication.

To fix this use-case, in 0.32.0 we've implemented a cuckoo filter on label names that is updated every 10 seconds. Using it we can detect whether deduplication was requested on internal labels. If that is the case then the series set is resorted before being sent off to the querier. It is strongly recommended to set replica labels which are external labels because otherwise the optimization cannot be applied and your queries will be slower by 20-30%.

In the future we have plans to expose this cuckoo filter through the InfoAPI. This will allow better scoping queries to StoreAPIs.

## Experimental PromQL Engine

By default, Thanos querier comes with standard Prometheus PromQL engine. However, when `--query.promql-engine=thanos` is specified, Thanos will use [experimental Thanos PromQL engine](http://github.com/thanos-community/promql-engine) which is a drop-in, efficient implementation of PromQL engine with query planner and optimizers.

To learn more, see [the introduction talk](https://youtu.be/pjkWzDVxWk4?t=3609) from [the PromConEU 2022](https://promcon.io/2022-munich/talks/opening-pandoras-box-redesigning/).

This feature is still **experimental** given active development. All queries should be supported due to bulit-in fallback to old PromQL if something is not yet implemented.

For new engine bugs/issues, please use https://github.com/thanos-community/promql-engine GitHub issues.

## Query API Overview

As mentioned, Query API exposed by Thanos is guaranteed to be compatible with [Prometheus 2.x. API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/). However for additional Thanos features on top of Prometheus, Thanos adds:

* partial response behaviour
* several additional parameters listed below
* custom response fields.

Let's walk through all of those extensions:

### Partial Response

QueryAPI and StoreAPI has additional behaviour controlled via query parameter called [PartialResponseStrategy](../../pkg/store/storepb/rpc.pb.go).

This parameter controls tradeoff between accuracy and availability.

Partial response is a potentially missed result within query against QueryAPI or StoreAPI. This can happen if one of StoreAPIs is returning error or timeout whereas couple of others returns success. It does not mean you are missing data, you might lucky enough that you actually get the correct data as the broken StoreAPI did not have anything for your query.

If partial response happen QueryAPI returns human readable warnings explained [here](#custom-response-fields).

Now it supports two strategies:
* "warn"
* "abort" (default)

NOTE: Having a warning does not necessarily mean partial response (e.g no store matched query warning).

Querier also allows to configure different timeouts:

* `--query.timeout`
* `--store.response-timeout`

If you prefer availability over accuracy you can set tighter timeout to underlying StoreAPI than overall query timeout. If partial response strategy is NOT `abort`, this will "ignore" slower StoreAPIs producing just warning with 200 status code response.

### Deduplication replica labels.

| HTTP URL/FORM parameter | Type       | Default                                      | Example                                         |
|-------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `replicaLabels`         | `[]string` | `query.replica-label` flag (default: empty). | `replicaLabels=replicaA&replicaLabels=replicaB` |
|                         |            |                                              |                                                 |

This overwrites the `query.replica-label` cli flag to allow dynamic replica labels at query time.

### Deduplication Enabled

| HTTP URL/FORM parameter | Type      | Default                                                         | Example                                |
|-------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `dedup`                 | `Boolean` | True, but effect depends on `query.replica` configuration flag. | `1, t, T, TRUE, true, True` for "True" |
|                         |           |                                                                 |                                        |

This controls if query results should be deduplicated using the replica labels.

### Auto downsampling

| HTTP URL/FORM parameter | Type                                   | Default                                                                  | Example |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `max_source_resolution` | `Float64/time.Duration/model.Duration` | `step / 5` or `0` if `query.auto-downsampling` is false (default: False) | `5m`    |
|                         |                                        |                                                                          |         |

Max source resolution is max resolution in seconds we want to use for data we query for.

Available options:

* `auto` - Select downsample resolution automatically based on the query.
* `0` - Only use raw data.
* `5m` - Use max 5m downsampling.
* `1h` - Use max 1h downsampling.

### Partial Response Strategy

// TODO(bwplotka): Update. This will change to "strategy" soon as [PartialResponseStrategy enum here](../../pkg/store/storepb/rpc.proto)

| HTTP URL/FORM parameter | Type      | Default                                       | Example                                |
|-------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `partial_response`      | `Boolean` | `query.partial-response` flag (default: True) | `1, t, T, TRUE, true, True` for "True" |
|                         |           |                                               |                                        |

If true, then all storeAPIs that will be unavailable (and thus return no data) will not cause query to fail, but instead return warning.

### Custom Response Fields

Any additional field does not break compatibility, however there is no guarantee that Grafana or any other client will understand those.

Currently Thanos UI exposed by Thanos understands

```go
type queryData struct {
	ResultType promql.ValueType `json:"resultType"`
	Result     promql.Value     `json:"result"`

	// Additional Thanos Response field.
	Warnings []error `json:"warnings,omitempty"`
}
```

Additional field is `Warnings` that contains every error that occurred that is assumed non critical. `partial_response` option controls if storeAPI unavailability is considered critical.

### Concurrent Selects

Thanos Querier has the ability to perform concurrent select request per query. It dissects given PromQL statement and executes selectors concurrently against the discovered StoreAPIs. The maximum number of concurrent requests are being made per query is controlled by `query.max-concurrent-select` flag. Keep in mind that the maximum number of concurrent queries that are handled by querier is controlled by `query.max-concurrent`. Please consider implications of combined value while tuning the querier.

### Store filtering

It's possible to provide a set of matchers to the Querier api to select specific stores to be used during the query using the `storeMatch[]` parameter. It is useful when debugging a slow/broken store. It uses the same format as the matcher of [Prometheus' federate api](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#finding-series-by-label-matchers). Note that at the moment the querier only supports the `__address__` which contain the address of the store as it is shown on the `/stores` endpoint of the UI.

Example:

```
- targets:
  - prometheus-foo.thanos-sidecar:10901
  - prometheus-bar.thanos-sidecar:10901
```

```
http://localhost:10901/api/v1/query?query=up&dedup=true&partial_response=true&storeMatch[]={__address__=~"prometheus-foo.*"}
```

Will only return metrics from `prometheus-foo.thanos-sidecar:10901`

## Expose UI on a sub-path

It is possible to expose thanos-query UI and optionally API on a sub-path. The sub-path can be defined either statically or dynamically via an HTTP header. Static path prefix definition follows the pattern used in Prometheus, where `web.route-prefix` option defines HTTP request path prefix (endpoints prefix) and `web.external-prefix` prefixes the URLs in HTML code and the HTTP redirect responses.

Additionally, Thanos supports dynamic prefix configuration, which [is not yet implemented by Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/3156). Dynamic prefixing simplifies setup when `thanos query` is exposed on a sub-path behind a reverse proxy, for example, via a Kubernetes ingress controller [Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/routing/routers/) or [nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/1805). If `PathPrefixStrip: /some-path` option or `traefik.frontend.rule.type: PathPrefixStrip` Kubernetes Ingress annotation is set, then `Traefik` writes the stripped prefix into X-Forwarded-Prefix header. Then, `thanos query --web.prefix-header=X-Forwarded-Prefix` will serve correct HTTP redirects and links prefixed by the stripped path.

## File SD

`--store.sd-files` flag provides a path to a JSON or YAML formatted file, which contains a list of targets in [Prometheus target format](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#file_sd_config).

Example file SD file in YAML:

```
- targets:
  - prometheus-0.thanos-sidecar:10901
  - prometheus-1.thanos-sidecar:10901
  - thanos-store:10901
  - thanos-short-store:10901
  - thanos-rule:10901
- targets:
  - prometheus-0.thanos-sidecar.infra:10901
  - prometheus-1.thanos-sidecar.infra:10901
  - thanos-store.infra:10901
```

## Active Query Tracking

`--query.active-query-path` is an option which allows the user to specify a directory which will contain a `queries.active` file to track active queries. To enable this feature, the user has to specify a directory other than "", since that is skipped being the default.

## Flags

```$ mdox-exec="thanos query --help"

                                 In such cases, Thanos UI will use default
                                 step to calculate resolution (resolution
                                 = max(rangeSeconds / 250, defaultStep)).
                                 This will not work from Grafana, but Grafana
                                 has __step variable which can be used.
      --query.lookback-delta=QUERY.LOOKBACK-DELTA
                                 The maximum lookback duration for retrieving
                                 metrics during expression evaluations.
                                 PromQL always evaluates the query for the
                                 certain timestamp (query range timestamps are
                                 deduced by step). Since scrape intervals might
                                 be different, PromQL looks back for given
                                 amount of time to get latest sample. If it
                                 exceeds the maximum lookback delta it assumes
                                 series is stale and returns none (a gap).
                                 This is why lookback delta should be set to at
                                 least 2 times of the slowest scrape interval.
                                 If unset it will use the promql default of 5m.
      --query.max-concurrent=20  Maximum number of queries processed
                                 concurrently by query node.
      --query.max-concurrent-select=4
                                 Maximum number of select requests made
                                 concurrently per a query.
      --query.metadata.default-time-range=0s
                                 The default metadata time range duration for
                                 retrieving labels through Labels and Series API
                                 when the range parameters are not specified.
                                 The zero value means range covers the time
                                 since the beginning.
      --query.partial-response   Enable partial response for queries if
                                 no partial_response param is specified.
                                 --no-query.partial-response for disabling.
      --query.promql-engine=prometheus
                                 Default PromQL engine to use.
      --query.replica-label=QUERY.REPLICA-LABEL ...
                                 Labels to treat as a replica indicator along
                                 which data is deduplicated. Still you will
                                 be able to query without deduplication using
                                 'dedup=false' parameter. Data includes time
                                 series, recording rules, and alerting rules.
      --query.telemetry.request-duration-seconds-quantiles=0.1... ...
                                 The quantiles for exporting metrics about the

                                 info endpoint (repeated).
      --store=<store> ...        Deprecation Warning - This flag is deprecated
                                 and replaced with `endpoint`. Addresses of
                                 statically configured store API servers
                                 (repeatable). The scheme may be prefixed with
                                 'dns+' or 'dnssrv+' to detect store API servers
                                 through respective DNS lookups.

                                 that are always used, even if the health check
                                 fails. Useful if you have a caching layer on
                                 top.
      --store.limits.request-samples=0
                                 The maximum samples allowed for a single
                                 Series request, The Series call fails if
                                 this limit is exceeded. 0 means no limit.
                                 NOTE: For efficiency the limit is internally
                                 implemented as 'chunks limit' considering each
                                 chunk contains a maximum of 120 samples.
      --store.limits.request-series=0
                                 The maximum series allowed for a single Series
                                 request. The Series call fails if this limit is
                                 exceeded. 0 means no limit.
      --store.response-timeout=0ms
                                 If a Store doesn't send any data in this
                                 specified duration then a Store will be ignored
                                 and partial data will be returned if it's
                                 enabled. 0 disables timeout.
      --store.sd-dns-interval=30s
                                 Interval between DNS resolutions.
      --store.sd-files=<path> ...
                                 Path to files that contain addresses of store
                                 API servers. The path can be a glob pattern
                                 (repeatable).
      --store.sd-interval=5m     Refresh interval to re-read file SD files.
                                 It is used as a resync fallback.
      --store.unhealthy-timeout=5m
                                 Timeout before an unhealthy store is cleaned
                                 from the store UI page.
      --tracing.config=<content>
                                 Alternative to 'tracing.config-file' flag
                                 (mutually exclusive). Content of YAML file
                                 with tracing configuration. See format details:

      --version                  Show application version.
      --web.disable-cors         Whether to disable CORS headers to be set by
                                 Thanos. By default Thanos sets CORS headers to
                                 be allowed by all.
      --web.external-prefix=""   Static prefix for all HTML links and
                                 redirect URLs in the UI query web interface.
                                 Actual endpoints are still served on / or the
                                 web.route-prefix. This allows thanos UI to be
                                 served behind a reverse proxy that strips a URL
                                 sub-path.
      --web.prefix-header=""     Name of HTTP request header used for dynamic
                                 prefixing of UI links and redirects.
                                 This option is ignored if web.external-prefix
                                 argument is set. Security risk: enable
                                 this option only if a reverse proxy in
                                 front of thanos is resetting the header.
                                 The --web.prefix-header=X-Forwarded-Prefix
                                 option can be useful, for example, if Thanos
                                 UI is served via Traefik reverse proxy with
                                 PathPrefixStrip option enabled, which sends the
                                 stripped prefix value in X-Forwarded-Prefix
                                 header. This allows thanos UI to be served on a
                                 sub-path.
      --web.route-prefix=""      Prefix for API and UI endpoints. This allows
                                 thanos UI to be served on a sub-path.
                                 Defaults to the value of --web.external-prefix.
                                 This option is analogous to --web.route-prefix
                                 of Prometheus.

## Exported metrics

Thanos Query also exports metrics about its own performance. You can find a list with these metrics below.

**Disclaimer**: this list is incomplete. The remaining metrics will be added over time.
