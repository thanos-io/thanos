# Developer Onboarding

This document would help new developers who want to get up and running with Thanos for contributing a technical PR. It contains explanation of different components of Thanos and how they work internally. Each of the components are explained thoroughly and it is expected that after reading this document, the user would be equipped with conceptual clarity to understand and question the internal working of Thanos.

Since this is a live document, please feel free to submit a PR for a component whose detailed explanation is missing / or could be improved.
