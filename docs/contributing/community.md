# Community

Thanos is an open source project from the very first commit. We always value and welcome new contributors and members of the community.
Here are ways to get in touch with the community:

### Social Media and Announcements

### Thanos Community Meetings

Thanos Community Meeting is a **public** and **recorded** monthly meeting every second Wednesday 13:00 UTC ([Time zone converter](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=13%3A00%20pm&tz=UTC%20(Coordinated%20Universal%20Time)&)).

Thanos maintainers & the community meet to discuss open issues, features and other Thanos related things.
Everyone is welcome to join & add items to the agenda. The meeting happens in Zoom. Right now meeting is in a Webinar format, where only small amount of people will have ability to speak and video share, due to recent [Zoombombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoombombing) issues.
