#### How to Bring the Topic you are/want to Contribute to?

1. Put your name (suggest Google Documents mode) on the Agenda with a related topic.
2. Notify the maintainer that you wish to speak with or that maintains the component that the change refers to (Slack #thanos-dev channel)
3. If the agenda topic is approved, we will make you a Panelist (you will be able to speak, show cam, present screen, etc), so we can collaborate and speak about the change (:

#### Rules

* The [CNCF Code of Conduct applies](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* The meeting will happen in a form of a public, recorded Zoom Webinar.
* Anyone can join as a viewer.
* People that we know and those who have a "registered" agenda item will be added as panelists when the meeting starts (if they are present).
* Try to timebox discussions to max 15-20min, unless there are no other agenda items. (:
* No announcements and marketing, just pure discussions over pending features/bugs/PRs especially contributed by other contributors than maintainers.
* Focus on inclusiveness and friendliness:
  * No grumpiness allowed. (:
  * Any opinion is welcome, no straight rejections without nice explanations, etc. (:
* We cancel the meeting if there aren’t any items on the agenda the day before the meeting.

### Slack

* General channel: [#thanos](https://slack.cncf.io/)
* Development related channel, PR discussions: [#thanos-dev](https://slack.cncf.io/)

### Prometheus Communication Channels

Since we are active Prometheus contributors and, some of us, maintainers we are also available on [Prometheus IRC and email-list channels](https://prometheus.io/community/)

### Prometheus Community & Ecosystem Meetings

The Prometheus & The Ecosystem community meeting is intended to provide a holistic overview of community activities, critical release information, and governance updates for Prometheus & the Ecosystem projects.

Thanos Maintainers regularly join and give announcements and updates.

#### Community Office Hours Shepherding

Schedule:

| Month   | Shepherd (GitHub handle) |
|---------|:-------------------------|
| 2022.13 | TBD                      |
| 2022.12 | TBD                      |

Each month we rotate the role of Community Office Shepherds among Team Members. This role is focused on leading the safe and friendly discussions during our [Community Office Hours](#thanos-community-office-hours).

> NOTE: Being shepherd does not mean other team members can chill out completely. (: It's a joint effort, so ideally there are multiple team members on those meetings to make decisions if needed.

> NOTE: If for some reason you as a shepherd can't make it, find replacement or cancel the meeting.

##### Responsibilities

The Same Day Morning Before Meeting:

* Add entry for today on the [agenda document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/137XnxfOT2p1NcNUq6NWZjwmtlSdA6Wyti86Pd6cyQhs.
* Announce meeting and call for agenda the same day morning on #thanos-dev and Twitter (`@ThanosMetrics` or your own account retweeted by ThanosMetrics).

30 minutes Before:

* Check agenda. If there are no topic, cancel the meeting. Announce cancellation on #thanos-dev and remove calendar item (anyone in `thanos-io@googlegroup.io` should have access).
* If there are topics, clean and add suggestions if they make sense.

2 minutes Before (if meeting was not cancelled):

* Log in to Zoom as `cncf-thanos-project@cncf.io` to be a meeting Host. This will allow you to have a control over meeting and Meeting options. Passwords can be found in our Keybase files.
  * If 2FA kicks-in, you will get message in https://lists.cncf.io/ for `cncf-thanos-maintianers@lists.cncf.io` (`cncf-thanos-project@cncf.io` is just an alias). Login there (you need to be in this list, talked to `amye@linuxfoundation.org` if you are not) and check `Admin > Pending` messages.
* We moved to `Meetings` so there is no need to start the meeting - it will start automatically. Join as `cncf-thanos-project@cncf.io` to host conversation.
* You don't need to answer all questions (or know how), just triage the potential questions and finish early if no other topics!
* In case of problems start another meeting or edit options of recurring meeting `Meeting` tab:

1 Day After Meeting (if meeting was not cancelled):

* Check `Recording` tab in Zoom and share recording on Twitter.
