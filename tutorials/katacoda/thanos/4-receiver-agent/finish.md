# Summary

Congratulations! 🎉🎉🎉
You completed this Prometheus Agent tutorial. Let's summarize what we learned:

* Thanos Receive is a component that implements the `Prometheus Remote Write` protocol.
* Prometheus Agent can be deployed to remote write its metric data in real-time to another server that implements the Remote Write protocol.
* Prometheus Agent uses a _fraction_ of the resources as normal Prometheus, by not enabling features like: local metrics storage and local query APIs.

See next courses for other tutorials about different deployment models and more advanced features of Thanos!
