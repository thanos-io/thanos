# Intermediate: Streaming metrics from remote source with Thanos Receive

The [Thanos](thanos.io) project defines a set of components that can be composed together into a highly available metric system with **unlimited storage capacity** that **seamlessly** integrates into your existing Prometheus deployments.

In this course you get first-hand experience building and deploying this infrastructure yourself.

In this tutorial, you will learn:

* How to ingest metrics data from Prometheus instances without ingress traffic and need to store data locally for longer time.
* How to setup a Thanos Querier to access this data.
* How Thanos Receive is different from Thanos Sidecar, and when is the right time to use each of them.

> NOTE: This course uses docker containers with pre-built Thanos, Prometheus, and Minio Docker images available publicly.
